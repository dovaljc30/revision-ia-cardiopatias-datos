N2  - We established a web-based ubiquitous health management (UHM) system, “ECG4UHM”, for processing ECG signals with AI-enabled models to recognize hybrid arrhythmia patterns, including atrial premature atrial complex (APC), atrial fibrillation (AFib), ventricular premature complex (VPC), and ventricular tachycardia (VT), versus normal sinus rhythm (NSR). The analytical model coupled machine learning methods, such as multiple layer perceptron (MLP), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and naive Bayes (NB), to process the hybrid patterns of four arrhythmia symptoms for AI computation. The data pre-processing used Hilbert–Huang transform (HHT) with empirical mode decomposition to calculate ECGs’ intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). The area centroids of the IMFs’ marginal Hilbert spectrum were suggested as the HHT-based features. We engaged the MATLAB™ compiler and runtime server in the ECG4UHM to build the recognition modules for driving AI computation to identify the arrhythmia symptoms. The modeling extracted the crucial data sets from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia open database. The validated models, including the premature pattern (i.e., APC–VPC) and the fibril-rapid pattern (i.e., AFib–VT) against NSR, could reach the best area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) of approximately 0.99. The models for all hybrid patterns, without VPC versus AFib and VT, achieved an average accuracy of approximately 90%. With the prediction test, the respective AUCs of the NSR and APC versus the AFib, VPC, and VT were 0.94 and 0.93 for the RF and SVM on average. The average accuracy and the AUC of the MLP, RF, and SVM models for APC–VT reached the value of 0.98. The self-developed system with AI computation modeling can be the backend of the intelligent social-health system that can recognize hybrid arrhythmia patterns in the UHM and home-isolated cares. © 2022 by the authors.

N2  - Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of global mortality, diagnosed primarily through costly imaging modalities which are often overused in asymptomatic patients. Our project aims to develop an AI-based solution for CVD risk stratification using routine blood biomarkers, serving as a pre-imaging test. We used anonymized data from over 500,000 UK Biobank (UKB) patients with CVD assessments. Initially, 701 features including demographics, blood tests, medical conditions, and clinical assessments were selected. The UKB dataset was refined using an automated data curation pipeline to deal with outliers, duplicated fields, and missing values. Then, a hybrid XGBoost classifier was employed, with a scalable loss function, to address overfitting effects during the training process, yielding 0.83 accuracy, 0.82 sensitivity, and 0.84 specificity in diagnosing CVD comorbidities. Key biomarkers identified included blood pressure, BMI, and age. To our knowledge, this is the first case study which utilizes the UKB data towards the identification of cost-effective CVD (non-imaging) risk factors, thus reducing the reliance on imaging modalities. © 2024 IEEE.

N2  - In contemporary times, cardiovascular diseases have emerged as a significant and critical cause of mortality for individuals. Therefore, it would be a boon for human existence that there exists a technology with high accuracy capable of detecting these diseases at an earlier phase but it has emerged as a challenge for data processing techniques. It has been surveyed that machine learning algorithms are capable of analysing, predicting and generating judgements. Due to advancements in IoT a variety of sensors had been developed that had contributed towards the development of better ML methods. In few articles it is observed that cardiovascular diseases are anticipated by examining the symptoms. Therefore, using machine learning techniques, a new and better solution in this domain is proposed that can predict cardiovascular diseases with better accuracy. The proposed article examines the probability of a cardiovascular disease in humans and classifies patient risk levels using various data mining techniques. This article brings out the analysis of various machine learning-based algorithms that are implemented to predict cardiovascular diseases. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.

N2  - Cardio Vascular Diseases (CVD) are a cause of concern as the statistics regarding its mortality globally is alarming. World Health Organisation (WHO) describes CVDs as a group of disorders of the heart and blood vessels and include coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, rheumatic heart disease, and other conditions. Early detection of signs and symptoms of the diseases can lead to effective treatment of the diseases and in turn prevent premature deaths. Heart sounds, brief and transient, produced due to closing of valves can be effectively made use of to recognize abnormal heart conditions. In this work, various papers have been surveyed and their accuracy rates have been considered. In an attempt to better the accuracy the authors of this paper have considered the dataset collected from Kaggle and developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN model) and LSTM model that classifies the heart sounds into 3 groups (classes) namely, normal, murmur and artifact. The features are extracted using Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) Murmur class of sounds indicates an underlying serious issue. The model considered is able to achieve 96.5% accuracy for the test dataset. The work can be improved by adding various other layers to the model and can be deployed for use in hospitals wherein timely detection can save human life. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.

N2  - Background Echocardiography is an important diagnostic tool in cardiology as it is essential for heart disease treatment. However, its time-consuming nature and reliance on user expertise constitutes a challenge for its use in high-volume clinics. Artificial intelligence (AI) offers the potential to automate tasks performed manually by echocardiographers and promises to improve efficiency and diagnostic consistency. Aims To evaluate the integration of AI-based tools in a high-volume echocardiography department and assess the concordance of AI-generated measurements with manually-performed measurements. Methods The study was conducted in the echocardiography department of Bordeaux University Hospital. Over 2months, 894 echocardiograms were performed by operators with three experience levels (nurses, residents and experts), with measurements performed by AI and humans. The statistical analyses assessed measurement agreement between both. Results The AI system was successfully integrated into the hospital's infrastructure within 6weeks. Concordance analysis revealed good to very good agreement between AI and human measurements for most parameters, especially for ejection fraction (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]: 0.81, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.78–0.85) and Doppler-based flow measurements (mitral E wave velocity: ICC 0.97, 95% CI 0.95–0.98). Bland-Altman analysis showed a global mean difference of −4% with a standard deviation of 15%. Subgroup analysis revealed higher concordance for experts and residents compared with nurses (mean ICCs: 0.78 and 0.79 vs. 0.72, respectively). Conclusion AI can be effectively integrated into clinical echocardiography practice, with high agreement between AI and human measurements. Further research is needed to investigate the long-term impact on clinical outcomes and efficiency.

N2  - Objectives Cardiovascular diseases are one of the most common and serious conditions that affect people's health. The use of early-stage signs to diagnose cardiovascular disease is a major problem in the modern world. However, there is a need for less expensive tools that detect cardiovascular disease without overbearing procedures. Methods In this study, we develop ensemble hybrid and blending techniques for the early detection of cardiovascular disease. Firstly, the proximity weighted random affine shadow sampling is utilized to reduce risk of bias model learning. Next, principal component analysis extracts most relevant features to improve accuracy and computational time. After that, we developed two novel ensemble models: hybrid and blending. A hybrid model combines convolutional neural networks and temporal convolutional networks, while blending model places convolutional neural networks and temporal convolutional networks, and a deep belief network on base layer and highway networks on meta layer to enhance cardiovascular disease detection performance. A combination of 10-fold cross-validation on clinical cardiovascular data showed both ensemble methods surpassing conventional models achieving peak results through the blending approach. Results The blending model reaches 0.914 accuracy and 0.9097 F1-score yet the hybrid model shows 0.8496 accuracy with 0.8496 F1-score. The project utilizes Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) and Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) through explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques for achieving dependability and transparency. The methods deliver explanations to clinicians by showing how clinical characteristics influence the predicted results. Conclusion The proposed ensemble model demonstrates strong predictive capabilities combined with interpretability which allows its use in real-time operations for cardiovascular disease prediction.

N2  - Background Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a complex, life-threatening condition requiring noninvasive, accessible, and accurate diagnostic tools, particularly in resource-limited settings. Early and precise identification of PH and its subtypes is critical for effective management and timely intervention. Research Question Can deep learning (DL) methods applied to chest radiography (CXR) accurately detect PH and its subtype, congenital heart disease-associated pulmonary arterial hypertension (CHD-PAH)? Study Design and Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted with 4,576 patients, including 2,288 patients with PH, who underwent CXR followed by right heart catheterization (RHC) or transthoracic echocardiography. DL models were developed and validated for detecting PH (CXR-PH-Net model) and CHD-PAH (CXR-CHD-PAH-Net model). Internal testing used a data set of 2,140 patients (1,070 patients with PH), and additional validation included an RHC-confirmed internal cohort (1,158 patients) and an external RHC cohort (90 patients) from 2 independent hospitals. Model performance was evaluated primarily using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity. Results The CXR-PH-Net model achieved a sensitivity of 0.902 and an AUC of 0.964 for PH detection in the internal test set. In the RHC-confirmed cohort, sensitivity was 0.902 (AUC, 0.872) internally and 0.803 (AUC, 0.811) externally. The CXR-CHD-PAH-Net model demonstrated sensitivities of 0.859 and 0.870 with AUCs of 0.908 and 0.860 in the internal and external data sets, respectively. Meanwhile, the CXR-CHD-PAH-Net model showed favorable sensitivity in detecting CHD-PAH among patients with mild PH, with values of 0.813 and 0.846 in the internal and external datasets, respectively. Interpretation The CXR-PH-Net and CXR-CHD-PAH-Net models demonstrated high sensitivity as screening tools for PH and CHD-PAH, potentially facilitating early detection and triage for further evaluation, particularly in resource-limited settings. Further validation in diverse populations is warranted to enhance clinical generalizability. Clinical Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov; No.: NCT05566002; URL: www.clinicaltrials.gov

N2  - Automatic boundary detection of 4D ultrasound (4DUS) cardiac data is a promising yet challenging application at the intersection of machine learning and medicine. Using recently developed murine 4DUS cardiac imaging data, we demonstrate here a set of three machine learning models that predict left ventricular wall kinematics along both the endo- and epi-cardial boundaries. Each model is fundamentally built on three key features: (1) the projection of raw US data to a lower dimensional subspace, (2) a smoothing spline basis across time, and (3) a strategic parameterization of the left ventricular boundaries. Model 1 is constructed such that boundary predictions are based on individual short-axis images, regardless of their relative position in the ventricle. Model 2 simultaneously incorporates parallel short-axis image data into their predictions. Model 3 builds on the multi-slice approach of model 2, but assists predictions with a single ground-truth position at enddiastole. To assess the performance of each model, Monte Carlo cross validation was used to assess the performance of each model on unseen data. For predicting the radial distance of the endocardium, models 1, 2, and 3 yielded average R2 values of 0.41, 0.49, and 0.71, respectively. Monte Carlo simulations of the endocardial wall showed significantly closer predictions when using model 2 versus model 1 at a rate of 48.67%, and using model 3 versus model 2 at a rate of 83.50%. These finding suggest that a machine learning approach where multi-slice data are simultaneously used as input and predictions are aided by a single user input yields the most robust performance. Subsequently, we explore the how metrics of cardiac kinematics compare between ground-truth contours and predicted boundaries. We observed negligible deviations from ground-truth when using predicted boundaries alone, except in the case of early diastolic strain rate, providing confidence for the use of such machine learning models for rapid and reliable assessments of murine cardiac function. To our knowledge, this is the first application of machine learning to murine left ventricular 4DUS data. Future work will be needed to strengthen both model performance and applicability to different cardiac disease models. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

N2  - Atrial fibrillation (AF), a common cardiac arrhythmia, significantly increases the risk of stroke, heart disease, and mortality. Photoplethysmography (PPG) offers a promising solution for continuous AF monitoring, due to its cost efficiency and integration into wearable devices. Nonetheless, PPG signals are susceptible to corruption from motion artifacts and other factors often encountered in ambulatory settings. Conventional approaches typically discard corrupted segments or attempt to reconstruct original signals, allowing for the use of standard machine learning techniques. However, this reduces dataset size and introduces biases, compromising prediction accuracy and the effectiveness of continuous monitoring. We propose a novel deep learning model, Signal Quality Weighted Fusion of Attentional Convolution and Recurrent Neural Network (SQUWA), designed to learn how to retain accurate predictions from partially corrupted PPG. Specifically, SQUWA innovatively integrates an attention mechanism that directly considers signal quality during the learning process, dynamically adjusting the weights of time series segments based on their quality. This approach enhances the influence of higher-quality segments while reducing that of lower-quality ones, effectively utilizing partially corrupted segments. This approach represents a departure from the conventional methods that exclude such segments, enabling the utilization of a broader range of data, which has great implications for less disruption when monitoring of AF risks and more accurate estimation of AF burdens. Moreover, SQUWA utilizes variable-sized convolutional kernels to capture complex PPG signal patterns across different resolutions for enhanced learning. Our extensive experiments show that SQUWA outperform existing PPG-based models, achieving the highest AUCPR of 0.89 with label noise mitigation. This also exceeds the 0.86 AUCPR of models trained with using both electrocardiogram (ECG) and PPG data. © 2024 R. Yan, D. Cheng, R. Xiao, A. Fedorov, R.J. Lee, F.B. Nahab & X. Hu.

N2  - Various machine learning techniques are being implemented to deal with heart diseases because of their better performance and their ability to understand the relationship between various input and output features when compared to an experienced physician/doctor. These input features usually involve the values of various tests done on an individual. Many classification, clustering, and deep learning algorithms are being implemented by researchers from all around the world, but after looking at the increase in the rate of heart diseases every year, some more unexplored methods should be implemented along with the application of few techniques so as to enhance the results on the existing classification algorithms. In this paper, a new method of majority voting ensemble learning has been developed to identify the existence or non-existence of heart disease in an individual. In ensemble learning, various classification algorithms are combined to form a more powerful and an accurate algorithm. The algorithms such as logistic regression (LR), naïve Bayes (NB), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), support vector machines (SVM), Xtreme gradient boosting machine (XGBM), light gradient boosting machine (LGBM), and K-nearest neighbors (KNN) have been used. Each algorithm was individually implemented on the dataset, and based on the evaluated parameters for all of the algorithms, two ensembles were formed by combining the best algorithms. The constructed ensembles are Ensemble 1 consisting of SVC and LR and Ensemble 2 consisting of NBC, RF, SVC, and LGBM with an accuracy of 88.33% in both the ensembles. Other parameters like sensitivity, specificity, precision, and negative predictive value (NPV) were also calculated for every model. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

N2  - Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) persist as a formidable global health challenge, underscoring the imperative for advanced early detection mechanisms. The evolution of computational methods within healthcare has paved the way for transformative applications of machine learning, offering solutions that enhance diagnostic accuracy and contribute to the SDG-3; Good Health and Well-Being. This study aims to identify an algorithm with consistent performance across diverse datasets and integrate it into a comprehensive and user-centric approach to heart disease prediction. The investigation includes an examination of eight machine learning algorithms, three deep learning algorithms, and four heterogeneous datasets from the Kaggle. These algorithms' predictive performance is assessed through Precision, Recall, F1 score, Accuracy, and Area Under the Curve (AUC). A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) feature engineering approach is presented to boost predictive performance. An alternative feature selection method, Lasso, was explored, with PCA emerging as the optimal choice for accuracy in the given datasets. As such, the XGBoost algorithm with PCA achieves an impressive accuracy rate and F1 score of around 99% along with an excellent 97% AUC rate in disease prediction on the other dataset. The selected XGBoost model is integrated into a user-friendly web application, providing a holistic platform for heart disease management. Furthermore, we recommended an RPA, IoMT, and AI-based tailored solution to make our web application more reliable, which we have proven in our study is attainable. © 2013 IEEE.

N2  - Objectives. In heart failure, invasive angiography is often employed to differentiate ischaemic from non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy. We aim to examine the predictive value of echocardiographic strain features alone and in combination with other features to differentiate ischaemic from non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy, using artificial neural network (ANN) and logistic regression modelling. Design. We retrospectively identified 204 consecutive patients with an ejection fraction <50% and a diagnostic angiogram. Patients were categorized as either ischaemic (n = 146) or non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy (n = 58). For each patient, left ventricular strain parameters were obtained. Additionally, regional wall motion abnormality, 13 electrocardiographic (ECG) features and six demographic features were retrieved for analysis. The entire cohort was randomly divided into a derivation and a validation cohort. Using the parameters retrieved, logistic regression and ANN models were developed in the derivation cohort to differentiate ischaemic from non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy, the models were then tested in the validation cohort. Results. A final strain-based ANN model, full feature ANN model and full feature logistic regression model were developed and validated, F1 scores were 0.82, 0.79 and 0.63, respectively. Conclusions. Both ANN models were more accurate at predicting cardiomyopathy type than the logistic regression model. The strain-based ANN model should be validated in other cohorts. This model or similar models could be used to aid the diagnosis of underlying heart failure aetiology in the form of the online calculator (https://cimti.usj.edu.lb/strain/index.html) or built into echocardiogram software.

N2  - Early diagnosis of cardiovascular disease can significantly improve patient survival rates. Existing ECG classification research only considers offline mode, which cannot adapt to new category data. To address this issue, we propose a class-incremental deep and broad learning system (CIDBLS) to expand the model online based on new category data. CIDBLS is a fusion model of deep learning and broad learning. The multi-scale convolution (MSC) and cross-layer attention fusion (CLAF) modules are designed to extract generic ECG features, achieving intelligent fusion of features across different scales and layers. In this study, we derive the class-incremental learning algorithm based on the broad learning system and apply it to the ECG diagnostic task for the first time. The proposed method combines the powerful feature mining capability of deep learning with the fast online update characteristic of broad learning, thus supporting the dynamic online expansion of recognizable disease categories. In offline mode, the proposed method achieves a recognition accuracy of up to 100%. Furthermore, in the class-incremental learning mode, overall accuracies of 99.61% and 99.67% are achieved, with forgetting rates for previous categories of only 0.4% and 0.6%, respectively. The proposed method can adapt to newly collected clinical data, thus showing great potential for widespread application in clinical scenarios. © 2024 Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation.

N2  - Manual heart disease diagnosis with the electrocardiogram (ECG) is intractable due to the intertwined signal features and lengthy diagnosis procedure, especially for the 24-hour dynamic ECG signals. Consequently, even experienced cardiologists may face difficulty in producing all accurate ECG reports. In recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly neural network-based automatic ECG diagnosis methods have exhibited promising performance, suggesting a potential alternative to the labor-intensive examination conducted by cardiologists. However, many existing approaches failed to adequately consider the temporal and channel dimensions when assembling features and ignored interpretability. And clinical theory underscores the necessity of prolonged signal observations for diagnosing certain ECG conditions such as tachycardia. Moreover, specific heart diseases manifest primarily through distinct ECG leads represented as channels. In response to these challenges, this paper introduces a novel neural network architecture for ECG classification (diagnosis). The proposed model incorporates Lead Fusing blocks, transformer-XL (meaning extra long) encoder-based Encoder modules, and hierarchical temporal attentions. Importantly, this classifier operates directly on raw ECG time-series signals rather than cardiac cycles. Signal integration begins with the Lead Fusing blocks, followed by the Encoder modules and hierarchical temporal attentions, enabling the extraction of long-dependent features. Furthermore, existing convolution-based methods have been argued to compromise interpretability, whereas the proposed neural network provides improved clarity in this regard. Experimental evaluations on a comprehensive public dataset confirm the superiority of the proposed classifier over state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, a visualization method was employed to generate a location map that demonstrates the areas of the signal emphasized by the model, thereby enhancing interpretability.

N2  - Cardiovascular disease is one of the leading causes of death in the world. Accurately and rapidly diagnosis of this disease remains an important challenge in research. Different decision support systems (DSS) implementing Machine Learning (ML) techniques have been proposed in the literature. In this study, we attempt to build a DSS that implements ML and try to classify patients according to their clinical characteristics and four-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) recorded by mean of a smart watch. The principal goal of this study is to check whether the proposed DSS can play the same role as a standard ECG. Indeed, the obtained results suggest that this DSS can accurately screen and diagnose heart conditions and may be used as an alternative to a standard ECG. Moreover, among the four optimized ML techniques by grid search optimization technique, the Support Vector Machines achieved the highest accuracy score. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

N2  - Cardiovascular disease prediction uses various data and prediction models to predict an individual’s risk of heart disease. It is essential to preventive medicine because it allows doctors to prevent and avoid heart-related problems. Early scientists used a variety of methods to make predictions. These include machine learning, deep learning, data mining, IoT and other methods. Data mining techniques can extract meaningful patterns from more extensive data sets. Association rule mining (ARM) is a data mining technique that generates significant association rules that clinicians can use to explain the relationship between various risk factors and cardiovascular disease. In this study, we employed an extension of ARM called Weighted ARM (WARM) with 70,000 observations of heart disease data made available through Kaggle. In this process, a weight is calculated for each feature using different methods such as correlation matrix, chi-square test, information gain, information gain ratio (IGR), and correlation. Then, other data analysis techniques are used, and the model’s performance is evaluated. The brute force method is used to find the best combination of features to predict heart disease. Using an ensemble voting method combining KNN, decision tree, and Naive Bayes, an accuracy of 78.42% is achieved for the selected set of attributes.

N2  - Abstract: With the advancement of combinatorial chemistry and big data, drug repositioning has boomed. In this sense, machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques offer a priori information to identify the most promising candidates. In this study, we combine QSAR and docking methodologies to identify compounds with potential inhibitory activity of vasoactive metalloproteases for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. To develop this study, we used a database of 191 thermolysin inhibitor compounds, which is the largest as far as we know. First, we use Dragon's molecular descriptors (0-3D) to develop classification models using Bayesian networks (Naive Bayes) and artificial neural networks (Multilayer Perceptron). The obtained models are used for virtual screening of small molecules in the international DrugBank database. Second, docking experiments are carried out for all three enzymes using the Autodock Vina program, to identify possible interactions with the active site of human metalloproteases. As a result, high-performance artificial intelligence QSAR models are obtained for training and prediction sets. These allowed the identification of 18 compounds with potential inhibitory activity and an adequate oral bioavailability profile, which were evaluated using docking. Four of them showed high binding energies for the three enzymes, and we propose them as potential dual ACE/NEP inhibitors for the control of blood pressure. In summary, the in silico strategies used here constitute an important tool for the early identification of new antihypertensive drug candidates, with substantial savings in time and money.

N2  - Heart disease is becoming the biggest cause of mortality worldwide. Its early detection can considerably lower the risk of mortality and help to promote its successful treatment. However, this early detection necessitates regular monitoring of a wide range of clinical and lifestyle factors. This is why a growing number of studies are being conducted to automate the forecasting of cardiac diseases, beginning with an examination of ECG images, which is the first diagnostic test performed on patients and also the most simple and economical to conduct. This study investigates the use of three groups of ECG images acquired from three separate sets of cardiac patients, with different heart-related illnesses, and a set of healthy controls to predict heart disease using deep learning classifiers. The evaluation is carried out on a real-life dataset, and the results highlight really interesting findings. © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

N2  - The prevalence of heart disease continues to become a relevant issue globally. One of the most common symptoms in heart failure (HF) patients is peripheral edema. Peripheral edema can be caused by various underlying conditions. Thus, early detection and consistent monitoring are vital for its appropriate treatment. Several studies have explored the use of telehealth for a more accessible remote monitoring of HF patients. With the current gap in monitoring patients remotely, the proposed solution is a mobile application that detects the presence and severity of peripheral edema in HF patients. It allows patients to take a video of their extremities and a deep learning model in the application will evaluate the presence and severity of peripheral edema. The dataset collected consists of 150 photos for each edema stage. Transfer learning was utilized on a MobileNetV3 model with pre-trained weights from ImageNet. The model yielded an accuracy of 95.24% and recall of 0.96 on the test dataset, and an accuracy of 86.67% and recall of 0.95 during the field testing of the application. The high accuracy indicates that the model performs well in classifying different peripheral edema severity. Moreover, the high recall value shows that the model is able to accurately detect the presence of edema by minimizing false negatives. © ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2024.

N2  - Artificial intelligence can assist providers in a variety of patient care and intelligent health systems. Artificial intelligence techniques ranging from machine learning to deep learning are prevalent in healthcare for disease diagnosis, drug discovery, and patient risk identification. Numerous medical data sources are required to perfectly diagnose diseases using artificial intelligence techniques, such as ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, mammography, genomics, computed tomography scan, etc. Furthermore, artificial intelligence primarily enhanced the infirmary experience and sped up preparing patients to continue their rehabilitation at home. This article covers the comprehensive survey based on artificial intelligence techniques to diagnose numerous diseases such as Alzheimer, cancer, diabetes, chronic heart disease, tuberculosis, stroke and cerebrovascular, hypertension, skin, and liver disease. We conducted an extensive survey including the used medical imaging dataset and their feature extraction and classification process for predictions. Preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines are used to select the articles published up to October 2020 on the Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar, PubMed, Excerpta Medical Database, and Psychology Information for early prediction of distinct kinds of diseases using artificial intelligence-based techniques. Based on the study of different articles on disease diagnosis, the results are also compared using various quality parameters such as prediction rate, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, the area under curve precision, recall, and F1-score. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention requires an integrated, patient-centered, and healthy-people-centered, interdisciplinary approach from several disciplines, and begins with CVD risk assessment and identification of specific risk conditions. The present study aims to develop a toolchain that contributes to preventive efforts in the early and presymptomatic diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases with the greatest public health impact. The framework discussed here comprises a web application with a web form for data acquisition, a moderated database with aggregate statistical records that are machine learning ready, a series of statistical and machine learning models, and a framework for model deployment. The main effort evolves from photoplethysmography (PPG), a noninvasive optical technology that measures changes in volumetric blood flow. Contrary to established techniques of using optical signals for PPG in the infrared part of the spectra, our ongoing research assesses the utilization of the visible part of the spectra. This allows wider practical application possibilities, as it can bring statistical and machine learning models to mobile devices, primarily smartphones. In this paper we present the conceptual framework of interdependent steps, starting from data collection for a specific tailored data science application, discussing challenges of data acquisition and validation, challenges of preparing machine-learning-ready dataset, and finally, model development. We discuss derived cardiovascular assessment parameters (e.g. heart-rate variability, perfusion index, respiratory rate, SpO<inf>2</inf>) and possibilities of blood pressure estimation from the PPG signal as a main goal. Research results may prove important for the efficient estimation of associated cardiovascular system risks. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

N2  - We assessed the diagnostic potential of cardiovascular disease-associated microRNAs for the early prediction of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in singleton pregnancies of Caucasian descent in the absence of other pregnancy-related complications. Whole peripheral venous blood samples were collected within 10 to 13 weeks of gestation. This retrospective study involved all pregnancies diagnosed with only GDM (n = 121) and 80 normal term pregnancies selected with regard to equality of sample storage time. Gene expression of 29 microRNAs was assessed using real-time RT-PCR. Upregulation of 11 microRNAs (miR-1-3p, miR-20a-5p, miR-20b-5p, miR-23a-3p, miR-100-5p, miR-125b-5p, miR-126-3p, miR-181a-5p, miR-195-5p, miR-499a-5p, and miR-574-3p) was observed in pregnancies destinated to develop GDM. Combined screening of all 11 dysregulated microRNAs showed the highest accuracy for the early identification of pregnancies destinated to develop GDM. This screening identified 47.93% of GDM pregnancies at a 10.0% false positive rate (FPR). The predictive model for GDM based on aberrant microRNA expression profile was further improved via the implementation of clinical characteristics (maternal age and BMI at early stages of gestation and an infertility treatment by assisted reproductive technology). Following this, 69.17% of GDM pregnancies were identified at a 10.0% FPR. The effective prediction model specifically for severe GDM requiring administration of therapy involved using a combination of these three clinical characteristics and three microRNA biomarkers (miR-20a-5p, miR-20b-5p, and miR-195-5p). This model identified 78.95% of cases at a 10.0% FPR. The effective prediction model for GDM managed by diet only required the involvement of these three clinical characteristics and eight microRNA biomarkers (miR-1-3p, miR-20a-5p, miR-20b-5p, miR-100-5p, miR-125b-5p, miR-195-5p, miR-499a-5p, and miR-574-3p). With this, the model identified 50.50% of GDM pregnancies managed by diet only at a 10.0% FPR. When other clinical variables such as history of miscarriage, the presence of trombophilic gene mutations, positive first-trimester screening for preeclampsia and/or fetal growth restriction by the Fetal Medicine Foundation algorithm, and family history of diabetes mellitus in first-degree relatives were included in the GDM prediction model, the predictive power was further increased at a 10.0% FPR (72.50% GDM in total, 89.47% GDM requiring therapy, and 56.44% GDM managed by diet only). Cardiovascular disease-associated microRNAs represent promising early biomarkers to be implemented into routine first-trimester screening programs with a very good predictive potential for GDM. © 2022 by the authors.

N2  - Heart disease is one of the complex diseases and globally many people suffered from this disease. On time and efficient identification of heart disease plays a key role in healthcare, particularly in the field of cardiology. In this article, we proposed an efficient and accurate system to diagnosis heart disease and the system is based on machine learning techniques. The system is developed based on classification algorithms includes Support vector machine, Logistic regression, Artificial neural network, K-nearest neighbor, Naïve bays, and Decision tree while standard features selection algorithms have been used such as Relief, Minimal redundancy maximal relevance, Least absolute shrinkage selection operator and Local learning for removing irrelevant and redundant features. We also proposed novel fast conditional mutual information feature selection algorithm to solve feature selection problem. The features selection algorithms are used for features selection to increase the classification accuracy and reduce the execution time of classification system. Furthermore, the leave one subject out cross-validation method has been used for learning the best practices of model assessment and for hyperparameter tuning. The performance measuring metrics are used for assessment of the performances of the classifiers. The performances of the classifiers have been checked on the selected features as selected by features selection algorithms. The experimental results show that the proposed feature selection algorithm (FCMIM) is feasible with classifier support vector machine for designing a high-level intelligent system to identify heart disease. The suggested diagnosis system (FCMIM-SVM) achieved good accuracy as compared to previously proposed methods. Additionally, the proposed system can easily be implemented in healthcare for the identification of heart disease. © 2013 IEEE.

N2  - Despite their widespread use, machine learning (ML) methods often exhibit sub-optimal performance. The accuracy of these models is primarily hindered by insufficient training data and poor data quality, with particularly severe consequences in critical areas such as medical diagnosis prediction. Our hypothesis is that enhancing ML pipelines with semantic information such as those available in knowledge graphs (KG) can address these challenges and improve ML prediction accuracy. To that end, we extend the state of the art through a novel approach that uses KG embeddings to augment tabular data in various innovative ways within ML pipelines. Concretely, we introduce and examine several integration techniques of KG embeddings and the influence of KG characteristics on model performance, specifically accuracy and F2 scores. We evaluate our approach with four ML algorithms and two embedding techniques, applied to heart and chronic kidney disease prediction. Our results indicate consistent improvements in model performance across various ML models and tasks, thus confirming our hypothesis, e.g. we increased the F2 score for the KNN from 70% to 82.22%, and the F2 score for SVM from 74.53% to 81.71%, for heart disease prediction. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

N2  - Heart disease is among the most common causes of death worldwide, and it is critical to recognize the condition early on. Clinical professionals face a difficult task in determining whether or not a person is at risk of coronary artery disease since it necessitates extensive knowledge and the use of rigorous clinical tests. The goal of this study is to create a revolutionary heart disease prediction paradigm by going through three primary phases: “feature extraction, optimum feature selection, and prediction.” Initially, attributes such as “statistical and higher-order statistical features” are retrieved from the provided input data. “local binary pattern (LBP), arithmetic mean based LBP, harmonic mean based LBP, and geometric mean based LBP features” are retrieved from the suggested higher-order statistical characteristics. In addition, the original characteristics of the input datasets are retrieved. However, in this case, the “curse of dimensionality” appears to be the most serious problem, necessitating the extraction of the best features. As a result, a new lion using the suggested cub growth function algorithm selects the optimum features from the retrieved data. Finally, an optimized deep convolution neural network is used to forecast the specified characteristics. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - In the directions of modern medicine, a new area of processing and analysis of visual data is actively developing - a radio municipality - a computer technology that allows you to deeply analyze medical images, such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), chest radiography (CXR), electrocardiography and electrocardiography. This approach allows us to extract quantitative texture signs from signals and distinguish informative features to describe the heart's pathology, providing a personified approach to diagnosis and treatment. Cardiovascular diseases (SVD) are one of the main causes of death in the world, and early detection is crucial for timely intervention and improvement of results. This experiment aims to increase the accuracy of deep learning algorithms to determine cardiovascular diseases. To achieve the goal, the methods of deep learning were considered used to analyze cardiograms. To solve the tasks set in the work, 50 patients were used who are classified by three indicators, 13 anomalous, 24 nonbeat, and 1 healthy parameter, which is taken from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database. © 2023 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

N2  - Background and objective: Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is crucial in diagnosing cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). It is important to consider both temporal and spatial features in ECG analysis to improve automated CVDs diagnosis. Significant progress has been made in automated CVDs diagnosis based on ECG with the continuous development of deep learning. Current most researches often treat 12-lead ECG signals as synchronous sequences in Euclidean space, focusing primarily on extracting temporal features while overlooking the spatial relationships among the 12-lead. However, the spatial distribution of 12-lead ECG electrodes can be more naturally represented using non-Euclidean data structures, which makes the relationships among leads more consistent with their intrinsic characteristics. Methods: This study proposes an innovative method, Convolutional Residual Graph Neural Network (Conv-RGNN), for ECG classification. The first step is to segment the 12-lead ECG into twelve single-lead ECG, which are then mapped to nodes in a graph that captures the relationships between the different leads through spatial connections, resulting in the 12-lead ECG graph. The graph is then used as input for Conv-RGNN. A convolutional neural network with a position attention mechanism is used to extract temporal sequence information and selectively integrate contextual information to enhance semantic features at different positions. The spatial features of the 12-lead ECG graph are extracted using the residual graph neural network. Results: The experimental results indicate that Conv-RGNN is highly competitive in two multi-label datasets and one single-label dataset, demonstrating exceptional parameter efficiency, inference speed, model performance, and robustness. Conclusion: The Conv-RGNN proposed in this paper offer a promising and feasible approach for intelligent diagnosis in resource-constrained environments. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Automated classification of cardiovascular diseases from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals using deep learning has gained significant interest due to its wide range of applications. However, existing deep learning approaches often overlook inter-channel shared information or lose time-sequence dependent information when considering 1D and 2D ECG representations, respectively. Moreover, besides considering spatial dimension, it is necessary to understand the context of the signals from a global feature space. We propose MD-CardioNet, an efficient deep learning architecture that captures temporal, spatial, and volumetric features from multi-lead ECG signals using multidimensional (1D, 2D, and 3D) convolutions to address these challenges. Sequential feature extractors capture time-dependent information, while a 2D convolution is applied to form an image representation from the multi-channel ECG signal, extracting inter-channel features. Additionally, a volumetric feature extraction network is designed to incorporate intra-channel, inter-channel, and inter-filter global space information. To reduce computational complexity, we introduce a practical knowledge distillation framework that reduces the number of trainable parameters by up to eight times (from 4,304,910 parameters to 94,842 parameters) while maintaining satisfactory performance compatible with the other existing approaches. The proposed architecture is evaluated on a large publicly available dataset containing ECG signals from over 10,000 patients, achieving an accuracy of 97.3% in classifying six heartbeat rhythms. Our results surpass the performance of some state-of-the-art approaches. This paper presents a novel deep-learning approach for ECG classification that addresses the limitations of existing methods. The experimental results highlight the robustness and accuracy of MD-CardioNet in cardiovascular disease classification, offering valuable insights for future research in this field. © 2013 IEEE.

N2  - This paper addresses the challenge of accurately detecting heart disease from electrocardiogram images using a vision-based machine-learning approach. We propose a novel ensemble model that combines Vision Transformers with Residual Neural Network architectures to enhance detection accuracy across multiple heart conditions. Using a 12-lead electrocardiogram image dataset encompassing five distinct heart condition categories, our approach involves comprehensive image preprocessing and implementing two ensemble models: Vision Transformers + Residual Neural Network 18 and Vision Transformers + Residual Neural Network 50. Predictions are aggregated using a bagging technique to maximise performance stability and accuracy. Our results indicate that the Vision Transformers+ Residual Neural Network 50 model achieved the highest accuracy at 98%, significantly outperforming standalone Vision Transformers models with an accuracy of 92.80%. This study demonstrates the potential of integrating Vision Transformers and ResNet models for cardiovascular disease detection, offering a novel and effective solution for improving diagnostic precision in medical imaging.

N2  - Fibrillation (Fib) is the most well-known sort of sporadic heartbeat. The sporadic termination of electrical impulses causes the atria (the top chambers in the heart) to tremble (or fibrillate). Cardiovascular arrhythmias happen in older people with coronary disease. Now and again, individuals with Fib have no manifestations, and their condition is just recognizable upon actual assessment. The issues include inconsistent heartbeats when the heart is reliably in a sporadic mood, as anticipated through the patient well-being observation framework (PHMS). The PHMS proposed calculation is ready to anticipate the inconsistent pulses by the location of the R top in electrocardiogram signals (ECG) and the unpredictable beat anticipated by utilizing the P wave along with the QRS complex with the T wave for one heart cycle. Hence, this paper proposes a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), termed hybrid C-RNN, to proceed with the characterization and determination of the arrhythmic beats. This work also analyzes the QRS peak variations, followed by classification. The practicability of the heartbeat characterization utilizing hybrid C-RNN is completed by metrics like accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The proposed model achieved an accuracy of 98.57%, sensitivity of 1%, and specificity of 9.565217e-01%. This is compared best with some existing approaches in the result section. © 2024 IETE.

N2  - Heart auscultation, a simple and effective diagnostic approach for heart diseases, heavily relies on the subjective judgment and clinical experience of physicians, necessitating the urgent development of objective and intelligent heart sound diagnostic methods. Deep learning technology provides a new solution for this purpose, but its effectiveness depends on sufficient high-quality training data. To address the challenges of scarce training data and the limitations of existing methods in handling data scarcity, a novel diagnostic approach named MSSCNN, based on Mel Spectrograms (MSs) and an improved Siamese convolutional neural network (SCNN), is proposed in this paper to enhance intelligent heart disease diagnosis under limited data conditions. Specifically, the method first converts the heart sound signals into MSs and randomly selects a small number of samples as training data. Next, pair these training samples pairwise within the group to increase the number of training samples, and feed these paired samples into the MSSCNN model for feature extraction and classification. Then, input the test set samples into the model for performance testing. Finally, two experimental cases confirm that MSSCNN can efficiently utilize limited training samples to tackle the scarce data issue and achieve better intelligent heart disease diagnosis. This study not only provides new methods to solve the problem of scarce training data, but also opens up new avenues for objective, accurate and timely diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases.

N2  - Heart disease, alternatively known as cardiovascular disease, encases various conditions that impact the heart and is the primary basis of death worldwide over the span of the past few decades. It associates many risk factors in heart disease and a need of the time to get accurate, reliable, and sensible approaches to make an early diagnosis to achieve prompt management of the disease. Data mining is a commonly used technique for processing enormous data in the healthcare domain. Researchers apply several data mining and machine learning techniques to analyse huge complex medical data, helping healthcare professionals to predict heart disease. This research paper presents various attributes related to heart disease, and the model on basis of supervised learning algorithms as Naïve Bayes, decision tree, K-nearest neighbor, and random forest algorithm. It uses the existing dataset from the Cleveland database of UCI repository of heart disease patients. The dataset comprises 303 instances and 76 attributes. Of these 76 attributes, only 14 attributes are considered for testing, important to substantiate the performance of different algorithms. This research paper aims to envision the probability of developing heart disease in the patients. The results portray that the highest accuracy score is achieved with K-nearest neighbor. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

N2  - Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally. Early diagnosis and accurate prediction are critical for effective prevention and treatment. However, traditional machine learning (ML) models for CVD prediction face challenges such as data imbalance, lack of interpretability, and limited generalization across datasets, which restrict their practical application in healthcare. This study introduces a hybrid explainable artificial intelligence-based ML (HXAI-ML) model to address these limitations. The proposed framework combines advanced data balancing techniques, including Random Oversampling (RO), Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SM), RO+Tomek Link (TL), SM+TL, RO+Instant Hardness Threshold (IHT), and SM+IHT, with XAI tools like SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), and Permutation Importance Analysis (PIA). This integration enhances prediction accuracy while ensuring model transparency, allowing healthcare professionals to interpret decision-making processes effectively. The HXAI-ML model was validated on two benchmark datasets, Cleveland and Framingham, achieving superior performance. Combining TL and RO with the Extra Trees Classifier (ETC) yielded the highest results, with 98.78% accuracy and 98.82% precision on the Cleveland dataset, and 99.24% accuracy and precision on the Framingham dataset. These findings demonstrate the model's ability to outperform traditional approaches in both accuracy and interpretability. This research provides a scalable, clinically interpretable solution for early CVD detection, capable of improving decision-making and enabling personalized treatment strategies. The hybrid model represents a significant step toward integrating advanced ML into practical healthcare applications, improving patient outcomes.

N2  - Inadequate sleep can cause various health problems including heart disease and obesity. In this work, a sleep monitoring system that monitors human sleep patterns is developed using the internet of things (IoT) and Raspberry Pi. The system is designed to record any detected movements and process the data using machine learning to provide valuable insight into a person’s sleep patterns including sleep duration, the time taken to fall asleep, and the frequency of waking up. This information is very useful to provide the sleep disorder diagnostics of an individual including restless leg, parasomnia and insomnia syndrome besides giving recommendations to improve their sleep quality. Also, the system allows the processed data to be stored in the cloud database which can be accessed through a mobile application or web interface. The performance of the system is evaluated in terms of its accuracy and reliability in detecting sleep order diagnostics. Based on the confusion matrix, the results show the accuracy of the system is 90.32%, 91.80%, and 91.80% in detecting the restless leg, parasomnia and insomnia syndrome, respectively. Meanwhile, the system showed high reliability in monitoring 10 participants for 8 hours and updated the recorded data and its analysis in the cloud. © 2024 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

N2  - The leading cause of death among people around the world is cardiovascular disease (CVD). In order to prevent patients from other damages, precise diagnostics of CVD on time is a crucial factor. Researcher workers are inspired to apply machine learning (ML) for accurate and quick diagnosis of CVD. ML algorithm extracts patterns and hidden relationships in the medical dataset for detecting or predicting disease development. But the prediction of CVD is a challenging task. The increasing size of healthcare dataset has made it a complex task for practitioners to make disease predictions and understand the feature relations. And so, selection of crucial features in a dataset plays a key role in optimizing the performance of ML algorithm. This study develops an Automated Cardiovascular Disease Diagnosis using Honey Badger Optimization with Modified Deep Learning (ACVD-HBOMDL) Model. The major aim of the ACVD-HBOMDL technique lies in the classification of CVD using feature selection (FS) and hyperparameter tuning strategies. Initially, the ACVD-HBOMDL technique applies min-max scaler to preprocess the medical data. To elect an optimal subset of features, the HBO algorithm is used in this work. For CVD classification, deep learning modified neural network (DLMNN) classifier is used and its hyperparameters can be optimally chosen by Bayesian optimization. The experimental results of the ACVD-HBOMDL technique can be tested on benchmark medical dataset and the obtained results demonstrate the significant outcomes of the ACVD-HBOMDL technique over other existing techniques. © 2013 IEEE.

N2  - In cardiac cine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the heart is repeatedly imaged at numerous time points during the cardiac cycle. Frequently, the temporal evolution of a certain region of interest such as the ventricles or the atria is highly relevant for clinical diagnosis. In this paper, we devise a novel approach that allows for an automatized propagation of an arbitrary region of interest (ROI) along the cardiac cycle from respective annotated ROIs provided by medical experts at two different points in time, most frequently at the end-systolic (ES) and the end-diastolic (ED) cardiac phases. At its core, a 3D TV-\boldsymbol {L^{1}}$-based optical flow algorithm computes the apparent motion of consecutive MRI images in forward and backward directions. Subsequently, the given terminal annotated masks are propagated by this bidirectional optical flow in 3D, which results, however, in improper initial estimates of the segmentation masks due to numerical inaccuracies. These initially propagated segmentation masks are then refined by a 3D U-Net-based convolutional neural network (CNN), which was trained to enforce consistency with the forward and backward warped masks using a novel loss function. Moreover, a penalization term in the loss function controls large deviations from the initial segmentation masks. This method is benchmarked both on a new dataset with annotated single ventricles containing patients with severe heart diseases and on a publicly available dataset with different annotated ROIs. We emphasize that our novel loss function enables fine-Tuning the CNN on a single patient, thereby yielding state-of-The-Art results along the complete cardiac cycle. © 1982-2012 IEEE.

N2  - Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is caused by the abnormal functioning of the heart which results in a high mortality rate across the globe. The accurate and early prediction of various CVDs from the electrocardiogram (ECG) is vital for the prevention of deaths caused by CVD. Artificial intelligence (AI) is used to categorize and accurately predict various CVDs. Among different AI-based techniques, deep learning (DL)--based approaches are more effective in classifying various CVDs because they extract characteristics directly from the huge amounts of data needed to train the DL network. This paper proposes and compares the performance of a one-dimensional (1D), two-dimensional (2D) convolutional neural network (CNN), and a multi-branch convolutional neural network (MB-CNN) to classify various CVDs, namely, dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), myocardial infarction (MI) and coronary artery disease (CAD) from spectrograms of one-dimensional (1D) ECG records. The 1D ECG records are classified using a 1D CNN is proposed which achieves a maximum performance of 97.60 %. To boost performance, the 1D ECG recordings are converted into 2D-ECG spectrograms via the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and classified based on the proposed 2D-CNN with a maximum accuracy of 98.46 %. To further improve the classification performance, the obtained 2D- ECG spectrograms are classified using the proposed MB-CNN containing multiple branches which can capture various degrees of abstraction leading to a precise classification. The proposed approach using the MB-CNN model obtains an average test accuracy of 99.34 % for the classifications of five types of CVDs and 99.22 % for the classification of 5 classes of ECGs in the MIT-BIH database.

N2  - The integration of IoT and Deep Learning (DL) has significantly advanced real-time health monitoring and predictive maintenance in prognostic and health management (PHM). Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are widely used for cardiovascular disease (CVD) diagnosis, but fluctuating signal patterns make classification challenging. Computer-assisted automated diagnostic tools that enhance ECG signal categorization using sophisticated algorithms and machine learning are helping healthcare practitioners manage greater patient populations. With this motivation, the study proposes a DL framework leveraging the PTB-XL ECG dataset to improve CVD diagnosis. Deep Transfer Learning (DTL) techniques extract features, followed by feature fusion to eliminate redundancy and retain the most informative features. Utilizing the African Vulture Optimization Algorithm (AVOA) for feature selection is more effective than the standard methods, as it offers an ideal balance between exploration and exploitation that results in an optimal set of features, improving classification performance while reducing redundancy. Various machine learning classifiers, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), are used for further classification. Additionally, an ensemble model is developed to further improve accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves the highest accuracy of 96.31%, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing CVD diagnosis.

N2  - Background and Objective: The new type of Coronavirus (2019-nCov) epidemic spread rapidly, causing more than 250 thousand deaths worldwide. The virus, which first appeared as a sign of pneumonia, was later called the SARS-COV-2 with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome by the World Health Organization. The SARS-COV-2 virus is triggered by binding to the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE 2) inhibitor, which is vital in cardiovascular diseases and the immune system, especially in conditions such as cerebrovascular, hypertension, and diabetes. This study aims to evaluate the prediction performance of death status based on the demographic/clinical factors (including COVID-19 severity) by data mining methods. Methods: The dataset consists of 1603 SARS-COV-2 patients and 13 variables obtained from an open-source web address. The current dataset contains age, gender, chronic disease (hypertension, diabetes, renal, cardiovascular, etc.), some enzymes (ACE, angiotensin II receptor blockers), and COVID-19 severity, which are used to predict death status using deep learning and machine learning approaches (random forest, k-nearest neighbor, extreme gradient boosting [XGBoost]). A grid search algorithm tunes hyperparameters of the models, and predictions are assessed through performance metrics. Steps of knowledge discovery in databases are applied to obtain the relevant information. Results: The accuracy rate of deep learning (97.15%) was more successful than the accuracy rate based on classical machine learning (92.15% for RF and 93.4% for k-NN), but the ensemble classifier XGBoost method gave the highest accuracy (99.7%). While COVID-19 severity and age calculated from XGBoost were the two most important factors associated with death status, the most determining variables for death status estimated from deep learning were COVID-19 severity and hypertension. Conclusions: The proposed model (XGBoost) achieved the best prediction of death status based on the factors as compared to the other algorithms. The results of this study can guide patients with certain variables to take early measures and access preventive health care services before they become infected with the virus. © 2021

N2  - Cardiovascular diseases, which are currently the major causes of death globally, can be largely ameliorated through early detection and categorization. Electrocardiogram (ECG) tests have emerged as widely employed, low-cost and non-invasive procedures for evaluating electrical activities of the heart and diagnosing cardiovascular ailments. In this research, by using deep learning techniques to detect specific cardiac disorders like cardiac myocardial infarction(MI), arrhythmia, past history of myocardial infarction(PMI) and normal ECG patterns on a dataset containing patients with heart disease. We propose ECGConVT framework that combines Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) module for extracting local features, and Vision Transformer (ViT) module for capturing global features. The final classification is achieved by combining the two using Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) module. The experimental results indicate promise of ECGConVT in ECG image classification where it outperforms other approaches showing an average accuracy of 98.5%, F1-score: 98.7%, Recall: 98.8% and Precision: 98.5%. In order to meet the practical needs of clinical applications, we implemented a lightweight post-processing step to reduce the size of the model. © 2013 IEEE.

N2  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming a vital concept in medicine leading to a rapid emergence of important tools for medical diagnostics. Now, as a crucial machine learning tool in the field of computer vision, deep learning (DL) is being widely used in medical imaging. Furthermore, as reported in the medical literature, DL has been widely used in medical related research. However, the practical application of DL in clinical diagnosis is relatively small, and it is a new field that may have some challenges. How to effectively perform medical image analysis is a major problem in the field of disease diagnosis, and further diagnostic methods need to be developed. At this stage, DL could be viewed as a black box requiring knowledge of its internal workings, and hence presents some crucial technical challenges that need further methodological development. Thereafter with proper diagnostics, pre-operative computerized simulation planning can be carried out for use of appropriate surgical intervention technology. This paper presents important questions on cardiovascular disease (CVD) diagnostics, using this powerful and yet not adequately understood technology. It discusses issues brought by the paradigm shift of AI vis-à-vis DL in CVD diagnostics, provides possible solutions to potential issues, and envisions the future of the related machine intelligence applications. The discussed problems are dissected into the modular aspects of DL in relation to CVD image classification, segmentation, and detection. A proper perspective on management of these issues is the key to a successful technological implementation of DL in modern medical science.

N2  - The usage of wearable gadgets is growing in the cloud-based health monitoring systems. The signal compression, computational and power efficiencies play an imperative part in this scenario. In this context, we propose an efficient method for the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases based on electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. The method combines multirate processing, wavelet decomposition and frequency content-based subband coefficient selection and machine learning techniques. Multirate processing and features selection is used to reduce the amount of information processed thus reducing the computational complexity of the proposed system relative to the equivalent fixed-rate solutions. Frequency content-dependent subband coefficient selection enhances the compression gain and reduces the transmission activity and computational cost of the post cloud-based classification. We have used MIT-BIH dataset for our experiments. To avoid overfitting and biasness, the performance of considered classifiers is studied by using five-fold cross validation (5CV) and a novel proposed partial blind protocol. The designed method achieves more than 12-fold computational gain while assuring an appropriate signal reconstruction. The compression gain is 13 times compared to fixed-rate counterparts and the highest classification accuracies are 97.06% and 92.08% for the 5CV and partial blind cases, respectively. Results suggest the feasibility of detecting cardiac arrhythmias using the proposed approach. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

N2  - Background Early prediction of atrial fibrillation (AF) is crucial for reducing adverse outcomes. While artificial intelligence-enhanced electrocardiogram (AI-ECG) analysis shows promise in predicting AF, most approaches require digital ECG signals, limiting their application in settings where ECGs are stored as images. Objective We aimed to develop and validate an image-based AI-ECG approach for predicting incident AF across multiple datasets. Methods We used 1,163,401 ECGs from 189,539 patients in the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) dataset and 70,655 ECGs from 65,610 participants in the United Kingdom (UK) Biobank. The AI-ECG model was trained on ECG images processed to 310x868 pixels. Results The model achieved C-statistics of 0.754 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.747–0.761) in the BIDMC dataset and 0.723 (95% CI: 0.704–0.741) in the UK Biobank for predicting incident AF. Performance was maintained across key subgroups including outpatients, women, and non-white individuals. Compared with the CHARGE-AF risk score, the AI-ECG model showed superior performance (c-statistic 0.696 vs 0.667, P < .05) and provided significant additive value when combined (c-statistic 0.711, P < .0001). The model also performed well on smartphone-photographed ECGs (c-statistic 0.736). Saliency mapping indicated the model primarily focused on P-wave morphology and PR interval regions. Conclusion This image-based approach enables AI-ECG prediction of AF in settings without digital ECG infrastructure and provides additive value to known clinical risk scores

N2  - Background Although smartphone-based devices have been developed to record 1-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), existing solutions for automatic detection of atrial fibrillation (AF) often has poor positive predictive value. Objective This study aimed to validate a Cloud-based deep-learning platform for automatic AF detection in a large cohort of patients using 1-lead ECG records. Methods We analyzed 8528 patients with 30-second ECG records from a single-lead handheld ECG device. Ground truth for AF presence was established through a benchmark algorithm and expert manual labeling. The Willem Artificial Intelligence (AI) platform, not trained on these ECGs, was used for automatic arrhythmia detection, including AF. A rules-based algorithm was also used for comparison. An expert cardiology committee reviewed false positives and negatives, and performance metrics were computed. Results The AI platform achieved an accuracy of 96.1% (initial labels) and 96.4% (expert review), with sensitivities of 83.3% and 84.2%, and specificities of 97.3% and 97.6%, respectively. The positive predictive value was 75.2% and 78.0%, and the negative predictive value was 98.4%. Performance of the AI platform largely exceeded the performance of the rules-based algorithm for all metrics. The AI also detected other arrhythmias, such as premature ventricular complexes, premature atrial complexes along with 1-degree atrioventricular blocks. Conclusion The result of this external validation indicates that the AI platform can match cardiologist-level accuracy in AF detection from 1-lead ECGs. Such tools are promising for AF screening and have the potential to improve accuracy in noncardiology expert health care professional interpretation and trigger further tests for effective patient management.

N2  - Heart disease stands as a leading cause of mortality, presenting significant challenges in clinical data analysis for accurate prediction. However, modern advancements in machine learning (ML) have shown immense promise in leveraging vast healthcare datasets to predict and manage heart disease effectively. ML algorithms have exhibited exceptional efficacy in discerning intricate patterns within patient data, aiding in both early diagnosis and the amelioration of existing cardiac conditions. Despite widespread application of ML in various sectors, its utilization in forecasting cardiac illness remains relatively understudied. This paper introduces an innovative approach aimed at refining heart disease prediction accuracy through the strategic utilization of ML techniques to identify pivotal features. This study aims to create a reliable prediction model by examining various feature combinations and utilizing well-known classification techniques like decision trees, logistic regression, random forest, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), gradient boosting machines (GBM), XG Boost, and multilayer perceptrons. Through this comprehensive exploration, we seek to contribute to the enhancement of cardiac health prediction, thereby potentially improving patient outcomes and reducing the burden of heart disease on global healthcare systems. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.

N2  - Purpose: This paper proposes a CT images and MRI segmentation technology of cardiac aorta based on XR-MSF-U-Net model. The purpose of this method is to better analyze the patient's condition, reduce the misdiagnosis and mortality rate of cardiovascular disease in inhabitants, and effectively avoid the subjectivity and unrepeatability of manual segmentation of heart aorta, and reduce the workload of doctors. Method: We implement the X ResNet (XR) convolution module to replace the different convolution kernels of each branch of two-layer convolution XR of common model U-Net, which can make the model extract more useful features more efficiently. Meanwhile, a plug and play attention module integrating multi-scale features Multi-scale features fusion module (MSF) is proposed, which integrates global local and spatial features of different receptive fields to enhance network details to achieve the goal of efficient segmentation of cardiac aorta through CT images and MRI. Results: The model is trained on common cardiac CT images and MRI data sets and tested on our collected data sets to verify the generalization ability of the model. The results show that the proposed XR-MSF-U-Net model achieves a good segmentation effect on CT images and MRI. In the CT data set, the XR-MSF-U-Net model improves 7.99% in key index DSC and reduces 11.01 mm in HD compared with the benchmark model U-Net, respectively. In the MRI data set, XR-MSF-U-Net model improves 10.19% and reduces 6.86 mm error in key index DSC and HD compared with benchmark model U-Net, respectively. And it is superior to similar models in segmentation effect, proving that this model has significant advantages. Conclusion: This study provides new possibilities for the segmentation of aortic CT images and MRI, improves the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosis, and hopes to provide substantial help for the segmentation of aortic CT images and MRI. © 2022

N2  - Purpose The purpose of this study was to evaluate an artificial intelligence (AI) software that automatically detects and quantifies breast arterial calcifications (BAC). Materials and methods Women who underwent both mammography and thoracic computed tomography (CT) from 2009 to 2018 were retrospectively included in this single-center study. Deep learning-based software was used to automatically detect and quantify BAC with a BAC AI score ranging from 0 to 10-points. Results were compared using Spearman correlation test with a previously described BAC manual score based on radiologists’ visual quantification of BAC on the mammogram. Coronary artery calcification (CAC) score was manually scored using a 12-point scale on CT. The diagnostic performance of the marked BAC AI score (defined as BAC AI score ≥ 5) for the detection of marked CAC (CAC score ≥ 4) was analyzed in terms of sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results A total of 502 women with a median age of 62 years (age range: 42–96 years) were included. The BAC AI score showed a very strong correlation with the BAC manual score (r = 0.83). Marked BAC AI score had 32.7 % sensitivity (37/113; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 24.2–42.2), 96.1 % specificity (374/389; 95 % CI: 93.7–97.8), 71.2 % positive predictive value (37/52; 95 % CI: 56.9–82.9), 83.1 % negative predictive value (374/450; 95 % CI: 79.3–86.5), and 81.9 % accuracy (411/502; 95 % CI: 78.2–85.1) for the diagnosis of marked CAC. The AUC of the marked BAC AI score for the diagnosis of marked CAC was 0.64 (95 % CI: 0.60–0.69). Conclusion The automated BAC AI score shows a very strong correlation with manual BAC scoring in this external validation cohort. The automated BAC AI score may be a useful tool to promote the integration of BAC into mammography reports and to improve awareness of a woman's cardiovascular risk status.

N2  - These days, in light of the rapid developments, people work day and night to live at a good level. This often causes them to not pay much attention to a healthy lifestyle, such as what they eat or even what physical activities they do. These people are often the most likely to suffer from coronary heart disease. The heart is a small organ responsible for pumping oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the human body through the coronary arteries. Accordingly, any blockage or narrowing in one of these coronary arteries may cause blood not to be pumped to the heart and from it to the rest of the body, and thus cause what is known as heart attacks. From here, the importance of early prediction of coronary heart disease has emerged, as it can help these people change their lifestyle and eating habits to become healthier and thus prevent coronary heart disease and avoid death. This paper improve the accuracy of machine learning techniques in predicting coronary heart disease using data preprocessing techniques. Data preprocessing is a technique used to improve the efficiency of a machine learning model by improving the quality of the feature. The popular Framingham Heart Study dataset was used for validation purposes. The results of the research paper indicate that the use of data preprocessing techniques had a role in improving the predictive accuracy of poorly efficient classifiers, and shows satisfactory performance in determining the risk of coronary heart disease. For example, the Decision Tree classifier led to a predictive accuracy of coronary heart disease of 91.39% with an increase of 1.39% over the previous work, the Random Forest classifier led to a predictive accuracy of 92.80% with an increase of 2.7% over the previous work, the K-Nearest Neighbor classifier led to a predictive accuracy of 92.68% with an increase of 2.58% over the previous work, the Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (MLP) classifier led to a predictive accuracy of 92.64% with an increase of 2.64% over the previous work, and the Naïve Bayes classifier led to a predictive accuracy of 90.56% with an increase of 0.66% over the previous work. © 2021.

N2  - Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) is a life-threatening syndrome and the primary cause of many fatalities worldwide. Specifically, cardiac disease impairs blood vessel function and can result in coronary artery infections, which can ultimately cause mortality. Hence, there is a demand for a reliable, accurate, and feasible system to diagnose cardiac disease promptly and assist cardiologists in treating patients appropriately. However, the most significant challenge in heart disease prediction lies in identifying the behavioral patterns of CVD in the large volume of data as well as the time complexity that affects the detection efficiency. Meanwhile, the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques including the Machine learning (ML) and Deep Learning(DL) assists in the extensive and complex medical data analysis to recognize patterns in which the disease occurs and convert them as structural data for predicting the disease. Specifically, this systematic review compares 50 research publications, with an emphasis on the approaches, challenges, and findings regarding computational complexity, data requirements, feature limitations, and model portability. This systematic review analyzes the selected publications rigorously and assists in the identification of gaps in the literature making it helpful for researchers to create and implement in clinical settings, mainly on datasets pertaining to heart disease. Finally, the future prospects for CVD risk assessment and prediction are provided in this review contributes to develop more appropriate proposals for the future development of AI-based techniques.

N2  - Cardiovascular diseases have become a major cause of death due to factors such as underlying health conditions, perceived medical costs, and lack of timely treatment. The Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a tool widely used to record electrical heart signals for evaluating and treating these diseases. Many research studies have utilized machine learning and deep learning to detect and classify cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). This study proposed a new method that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNN) for the detection and classification of five types of CVDs, using PhysioNet's MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database. CNN helps extract significant features from the data, while RCNN aids in preventing overfitting. This method has achieved a macro accuracy of approximately 93 % and an average accuracy of approximately 99%. © 2024 IEEE.

N2  - H-type hypertension increases the morbidity of stroke and cardiovascular diseases, posing a great threat to human health. The existing diagnosis of H-type hypertension detects patients’ plasma homocysteine content, which is inefficient and leaves wounds. The pulse-taking diagnosis of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) can implement the non-invasive auxiliary diagnosis of H-type hypertension by the physiological activities of patient's pulse wave combined with the clinical inquiry information. Therefore, we propose a combined model of pulse-taking and inquiry diagnosis, which includes a pulse-taking model based on CNN-BiLSTM and an inquiry diagnosis model based on the integrated Cluster-RFs. We search the optimal weights for the heterogeneous integrated model dynamically by using Grid Search to classify H-type hypertension. The datasets are the collection of 364 cases H-type hypertension from Longhua Hospital affiliated to Shanghai University of Chinese Medicine and Hospital of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine concerning pulse-taking and inquiry diagnosis. The evaluation indicator of classification of H-type hypertension, i.e. Sensitivity, Specificity, Accuracy, F1-score, AUC, is 82.31%, 73.75%, 79.34%, 85.92%, 87.78% respectively, is higher than that of the other typical machine learning models on pulse-taking or inquiry diagnosis. In addition, this article also studies the correlation between pulse-taking or inquiry diagnosis and its attributes, and analyzes the feature importance ranking on pulse-taking and inquiry diagnosis, which aids clinicians seek the occurrence mechanisms of H-type hypertension, and find the reasonable measurements for timely prevention and treatment. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - Heart disease and other cardiovascular disorders continue to be the most prevalent cause of death. ML (Machine Learning) algorithms in particular have shown promise in forecasting for early identification and prevention. Using innovative preprocessing methods like Z-score normalization, IQR outlier handling, and Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) for class imbalance, the present research investigates the use of ANN (Artificial Neural Networks) in the early detection of cardiovascular disease. When compared with various preprocessing techniques, SMOTE and ANN regularly exceed them in terms of precision, sensitivity, and specificity, according to the results of the study. The balanced illustration of both positive and negative cases in the synthesized dataset gives the NN (Neural Network) a more thorough learning experience. Since there are fewer false negatives (greater sensitivity) and false positives (more specificity) due to the ANN model’s increased accuracy for forecasting heart disease, there are fewer false positives as well. From the results obtained proposed SMOTE+ANN produces Accuracy of 91%, Specificity of 0.86 and Sensitivity of 0.91. The tool used is Jupyter Notebook and language used is python. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

N2  - Cardiovascular Diseases (CVDs) have become increasingly crucial in recent years and have been regarded as the leading cause of death worldwide. Although it is necessary to detect and treat CVDs in their early stages, only 67% of heart diseases could be predicted by medical professionals. Motivated by recent advances in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that have ramified in a variety of industries, in this paper, we utilize three novel GNN models, including Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), GraphSAGE, and Graph Attention Network (GAT), to conduct the heart disease prediction task, comprised of two stages: table-to-graph transformation and Graph Neural Networks prediction. Experimental results show significant improvements with the utilization of GNNs compared with three novel Machine Learning models: Logistic Regression (LR), Naïve Bayes (NB), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and GAT performs optimally among the three GNN models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that predicts heart disease using GNNs. © 2023 SPIE.

N2  - Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) aredisorders of the heart and blood vessels and are a major cause of disability and premature death worldwide. Individuals at higher risk of developing CVD must be noticed at an early stage to prevent premature deaths. Advances in the field of computational intelligence, together with the vast amount of data produced daily in clinical settings, have made it possible to create recognition systems capable of identifying hidden patterns and useful information. This paper focuses on the application of Data Mining Techniques (DMTs) to clinical data collected during the medical examination in an attempt to predict whether or not an individual has a CVD. To this end, the CRossIndustry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) methodology was followed, in which five classifiers were applied, namely DT, Optimized DT, RI, RF, and DL. The models were mainly developed using the RapidMiner software with the assist of the WEKA tool and were analyzed based on accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity. The results obtained were considered promising on the basis of the research for effective means of diagnosing CVD, with the best model being Optimized DT, which achieved the highest values for all the evaluation metrics, 73.54%, 75.82%, 68.89%, 78.16% and 0.788 for accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC, respectively. © 2021, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Conventional machine learning techniques in diagnosing cardiovascular disease have a limitation owing to the lack of interpretability of models. This study utilised an explainable machine learning approach to predict the likelihood of having CVD. Four machine learning models were employed for CVD diagnosis: Decision Tree (DT), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Random Forest (RF), and Extreme Gradient Boost (XGB). Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) were used to provide reasoning for the models' predictions. Using these models and explanations, a user interface was developed to assist in diagnosing CVD. All four classification models demonstrated good accuracy in diagnosing CVD, with the KNN model showcasing the best performance (Accuracy: 71 %). SHAP provided the reasoning behind KNN predictions, and the predictive interface was developed by embedding these explanations to provide transparency behind the model's decisions. © 2024 The Author(s)

N2  - Background Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a rare genetic heart disease associated with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. Diagnosis of ARVC is based on the 2010 Task Force Criteria (TFC), application of which often requires clinical expertise at specialized centers. Objective The purpose of this study was to develop and validate an electrocardiogram (ECG) deep learning (DL) tool for ARVC diagnosis. Methods ECGs of patients referred for ARVC evaluation were used to develop (n = 551 [80.1%]) and test (n = 137 [19.9%]) an ECG-DL model for prediction of TFC-defined ARVC diagnosis. The ARVC ECG-DL model was externally validated in a cohort of patients with pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P/LP) ARVC gene variants identified through the Geisinger MyCode Community Health Initiative (N = 167). Results Of 688 patients evaluated at Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH) (57.3% male, mean age 40.2 years), 329 (47.8%) were diagnosed with ARVC. Although ARVC diagnosis made by referring cardiologist ECG interpretation was unreliable (c-statistic 0.53; confidence interval [CI] 0.52–0.53), ECG-DL discrimination in the hold-out testing cohort was excellent (0.87; 0.86–0.89) and compared favorably to that of ECG interpretation by an ARVC expert (0.85; 0.84–0.86). In the Geisinger cohort, prevalence of ARVC was lower (n = 17 [10.2%]), but ECG-DL–based identification of ARVC phenotype remained reliable (0.80; 0.77–0.83). Discrimination was further increased when ECG-DL predictions were combined with non–ECG-derived TFC in the JHH testing (c-statistic 0.940; 95% CI 0.933–0.948) and Geisinger validation (0.897; 95% CI 0.883–0.912) cohorts. Conclusion ECG-DL augments diagnosis of ARVC to the level of an ARVC expert and can differentiate true ARVC diagnosis from phenotype-mimics and at-risk family members/genotype-positive individuals.

N2  - This study investigates the use of deep learning (DL) models to predict low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. The dataset obtained from New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center includes triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). LDL-C prediction was performed using DL models such as CNN, RNN and LSTM and the results were compared with traditional machine learning (ML) and LDL-C formulas. The obtained results showed that DL models are more successful than traditional formulas while giving closer results to ML models. It is shown that DL models can predict LDL-C with higher accuracy compared to the Sampson, and Martin equation. In particular, RNN and LSTM models performed better in LDL-C prediction than the other formulas. In addition, the prediction results of DL models were explained using Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) method. The features of the proposed models provide more parameters to explain the AI Model better in comparison with the ML models but require more computational efforts to explain DL model decisions. The results demonstrate that DL models in predicting LDL-C levels are more effective than traditional methods for LDL-C prediction and can be used in clinical applications. As a result, the findings might provide significant contributions to assessing cardiovascular disease risk and planning treatment protocols.

N2  - Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are among the most concerning and common health issues causing millions of deaths every year, thereby exerting extra burden on healthcare systems globally. Given that heart disease is the leading cause of death globally, there has been an urgent need to find efficient risk prediction models that would help reduce the alarmingly increasing mortality rates over the years. This paper focuses on enhancing patient results and reducing mortality through early detection and diagnosis of heart disease. Although recently proposed new models have improved performance without testing accuracy, most algorithms still suffer from overfitting issues that limit their use in a real medical facility. In this paper, we propose a novel integrated model that combines the power of three different ML algorithms, namely RF, GBM, and SVM, using logistic regression (LR)-based stacked classifiers. This combination not only achieves higher results in all performance evaluation parameters, but also improves the robustness and generalisation by reducing the overfitting of the model. The model has a precision of 96.64%, a precision of 95.56%, a recall of 98.47%, an F1 score of 96.99%, and a ROC-AUC score of 97.63%, which are better than the existing model. These results demonstrate the potential of our model to be an effective tool for early diagnosis in clinical settings, which can facilitate timely intervention and improve patient outcomes.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Atrial Fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia worldwide with a global age adjusted prevalence of 0.5% in 2010. Anticoagulation treatment using warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants is effective in reducing the risk of AF-related stroke by approximately two-thirds and can provide a 10% reduction in overall mortality. There has been increased interest in detecting AF due to its increased incidence and the possibility to prevent AF-related strokes. Inexpensive consumer devices which measure the ECG may have the potential to accurately detect AF but do not generally incorporate diagnostic algorithms. Machine learning algorithms have the potential to improve patient outcomes particularly where diagnoses are made from large volumes or complex patterns of data such as in AF. METHODS: We designed a novel AF detection algorithm using a de-correlated Lorenz plot of 60 consecutive RR intervals. In order to reduce the volume of data, the resulting images were compressed using a wavelet transformation (JPEG200 algorithm) and the compressed images were used as input data to a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. We used the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)-Beth Israel Hospital (BIH) Atrial Fibrillation database and the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database as training data and verified the algorithm performance using RR intervals collected using an inexpensive consumer heart rate monitor device (Polar-H7) in a case-control study. RESULTS: The SVM algorithm yielded excellent discrimination in the training data with a sensitivity of 99.2% and a specificity of 99.5% for AF. In the validation data, the SVM algorithm correctly identified AF in 79/79 cases; sensitivity 100% (95% CI 95.4%-100%) and non-AF in 328/336 cases; specificity 97.6% (95% CI 95.4%-99.0%). CONCLUSIONS: An inexpensive wearable heart rate monitor and machine learning algorithm can be used to detect AF with very high accuracy and has the capability to transmit ECG data which could be used to confirm AF. It could potentially be used for intermittent screening or continuously for prolonged periods to detect paroxysmal AF. Further work could lead to cost-effective and accurate estimation of AF burden and improved risk stratification in AF.

N2  - Fetal arrhythmia is a critical condition that can cause severe complications and even sudden infant death if not detected in time. Early and accurate diagnosis is therefore essential to enable timely medical intervention and improve neonatal outcomes. Traditional detection methods are limited by low signal quality, due to the weak amplitude of the fetal ECG (fECG) and interference from the maternal ECG, which hinders reliable real-time, non-invasive monitoring. This work presents the development of a real-time, non-invasive, and embedded system for accurate fetal arrhythmia detection using deep learning applied to fECG signals. Abdominal and thoracic ECG recordings are preprocessed with Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to isolate the fetal component, followed by band-pass filtering and segmentation into 3-second windows. Each segment is classified by a lightweight one-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on annotated data from the Fetal Health Classification Dataset (Kaggle) and PhysioNet NIFECGDB and optimized for real-time inference on Raspberry Pi. Classification outcomes are transmitted to a mobile application for continuous monitoring and alerting. Experimental results demonstrate high performance, achieving 98.2 % accuracy, 98.8 % sensitivity, 97.4 % specificity, and a 98.1 % F1-score. The embedded implementation confirms the system’s suitability for portable, real-time fetal monitoring, offering a robust and accessible alternative to conventional medical analysis.

N2  - Background Deep learning has significantly improved medical diagnostics, particularly in electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis, yet accurate classification of arrhythmias remains challenging. Objective We propose Electrocardiogram Graph Convolutional Network (ECG-GraphNet), a graph convolutional network designed to classify arrhythmias into 3 types: normal (N), supraventricular ectopic (S), and ventricular ectopic (V) beats. Methods ECG-GraphNet utilizes a novel graph representation of ECG data in which the P wave, QRS complex, and T wave are modeled as individual nodes. A unique QRS-centered weighted average pooling method is employed to enhance beat-specific feature extraction. We systematically explored various aspects including node features, edge definitions, a data augmentation method, and architecture configuration to determine the optimal model design. Experiments were conducted on 10-second ECG recordings from 328 patients using a single-lead device. Results The optimized ECG-GraphNet achieved a Macro F1 score of 88.61% in 5-fold cross-validation. Scalability experiments further demonstrated its robustness, with Macro F1 scores of 85.21% and 87.03% across diverse ECG patterns and sizes. Conclusion Our novel approach and comprehensive analysis underscore the potential advantages of ECG-GraphNet in clinical diagnosis and monitoring.

N2  - Background Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, affecting up to 2 % of the population. Catheter ablation is a promising treatment for AF, particularly for paroxysmal AF patients, but it often has high recurrence rates. Developing in silico models of patients' atria during the ablation procedure using cardiac MRI data may help reduce these rates. Objective This study aims to develop an effective automated deep learning-based segmentation pipeline by compiling a specialized dataset and employing standardized labeling protocols to improve segmentation accuracy and efficiency. In doing so, we aim to achieve the highest possible accuracy and generalization ability while minimizing the burden on clinicians involved in manual data segmentation. Methods We collected LGE-MRI data from VMRC and the cDEMRIS database. Two specialists manually labeled the data using standardized protocols to reduce subjective errors. Neural network (nnU-Net and smpU-Net++) performance was evaluated using statistical tests, including sensitivity and specificity analysis. A new database of LGE-MRI images, based on manual segmentation, was created (VMRC). Results Our approach with consistent labeling protocols achieved a Dice coefficient of 92.4 % ± 0.8 % for the cavity and 64.5 % ± 1.9 % for LA walls. Using the pre-trained RIFE model, we attained a Dice score of approximately 89.1 % ± 1.6 % for atrial LGE-MRI imputation, outperforming classical methods. Sensitivity and specificity values demonstrated substantial enhancement in the performance of neural networks trained with the new protocol. Conclusion Standardized labeling and RIFE applications significantly improved machine learning tool efficiency for constructing 3D LA models. This novel approach supports integrating state-of-the-art machine learning methods into broader in silico pipelines for predicting ablation outcomes in AF patients.

N2  - The uneven distribution of sample points is a common problem in medical datasets. How to improve the classification accuracy with these datasets remains to be solved. Based on the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm, a weight learning approach is proposed to utilize the density information of datasets for the accurate prediction of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). The approach selects important features by the random forest (RF) algorithm, divides the sample points into three types and weights them using different values by weight learning based on the density. Thus, the constructed machine learning models that combine the original features and weight feature can learn density information, more effectively identify decision boundaries, and achieve better performance. Compared with conventional machine learning models, the cross-validation approach showed that the performance of machine learning models with weight learning could achieve improved accuracy by 3 percentage points with the Stroke dataset and more than 10 percentage points with the University of California, Irvine (UCI) dataset. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Background and Objective To develop an end-to-end artificial intelligence solution—video-based Multi-Point Tracking Network (MPTN), for detecting and tracking atrioventricular junction (AVJ) points from cardiovascular magnetic resonance and deriving AVJ motion parameters. Methods The MPTN model consists of two modules: AVJ point detection and AVJ motion tracking. The detection module utilizes convolutional-based feature extraction and elastic regression to detect all candidate AVJ points. The tracking module employs the optimized DeepSORT algorithm to dynamically capture spatio-temporal continuity between cardiac frames. The model was trained and evaluated on datasets from 286 subjects, including normal controls and patients with heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, pulmonary arterial hypertension, and repaired tetralogy of Fallot. AVJ motion parameters, including systolic velocity S’, early diastolic velocity E’, late diastolic velocity A’, and displacements, were derived from tracked trajectories. Results Our MPTN model demonstrated promising performance compared to ground truth, with correlations of 0.92 for S’, 0.93 for E’, 0.89 for A’ in mitral annular motion velocities, and 0.93 for mitral annular plane systolic excursion. For tricuspid annular motion, the correlations were 0.91 for S’, 0.90 for E’, 0.87 for A’, and 0.86 for tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion. The MPTN-derived AVJ motion parameters exhibited strong diagnostic capabilities in detecting echocardiography-derived ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction, with an area under the curve ranging from 0.83 to 0.88 and accuracies ranging from 78 % to 85 %. Conclusions Our work provides an initial framework for cardiac motion tracking and function evaluation, which may support future advances in diagnosis of heart diseases.

N2  - Machine Learning (ML) techniques have exploded in popularity, especially the use of ML in automated ECG interpretation, which has been widely addressed in the literature. Other applications of machine learning in cardiac electrophysiology as well as arrhythmia are even less well recognised. Yet, the contemporary models are evincing the considerable false alarming in the process of arrhythmia prediction. In order to improve the arrhythmia prediction accuracy, this manuscript portrayed a novel analytical progression scale (APS) that learns from the given input electrocardiograms with appropriate label positive (prone to arrhythmia) or negative (not prone to arrhythmia). The experimental study has carried a 10-fold cross validation strategy on proposed and other contemporary models to scale the performance advantage of the proposed Analytical Progression Scale that compare those statistical values obtained for performance metrics such as precision, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. The results obtained from cross validation are evincing that the proposed model APS is outperforming the other contemporary models. © 2022, Ismail Saritas. All rights reserved.

N2  - Accurate assessment of cardiac function is crucial for the diagnosis of cardiovascular disease1, screening for cardiotoxicity2 and decisions regarding the clinical management of patients with a critical illness3. However, human assessment of cardiac function focuses on a limited sampling of cardiac cycles and has considerable inter-observer variability despite years of training4,5. Here, to overcome this challenge, we present a video-based deep learning algorithm-EchoNet-Dynamic-that surpasses the performance of human experts in the critical tasks of segmenting the left ventricle, estimating ejection fraction and assessing cardiomyopathy. Trained on echocardiogram videos, our model accurately segments the left ventricle with a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.92, predicts ejection fraction with a mean absolute error of 4.1% and reliably classifies heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (area under the curve of 0.97). In an external dataset from another healthcare system, EchoNet-Dynamic predicts the ejection fraction with a mean absolute error of 6.0% and classifies heart failure with reduced ejection fraction with an area under the curve of 0.96. Prospective evaluation with repeated human measurements confirms that the model has variance that is comparable to or less than that of human experts. By leveraging information across multiple cardiac cycles, our model can rapidly identify subtle changes in ejection fraction, is more reproducible than human evaluation and lays the foundation for precise diagnosis of cardiovascular disease in real time. As a resource to promote further innovation, we also make publicly available a large dataset of 10,030 annotated echocardiogram videos.

N2  - Inherited cardiomyopathies are a significant global cause of sudden cardiac death, particularly among younger individuals and those in under-resourced regions. Despite progress in diagnostics and therapeutics, screening and risk stratification remain challenging due to genetic complexity, variable clinical presentation, and the interpretive limitations of current electrophysiological and imaging tools. Artificial intelligence (AI)—particularly machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing offers transformative potential by enabling large-scale analysis of complex data and detecting subtle disease patterns which could potentially improve diagnostic accuracy and cost-effectiveness, particularly in low-resource environments. This review evaluates the limitations of existing risk models, synthesizes disease-specific AI applications within a unified framework, and explores the role of AI in advancing personalized care and risk prediction in underserved populations.

N2  - Currently, heart disease is the leading cause of death in world. Since cardiac sickness requires knowledge and detailed information, it is challenging to anticipate. Healthcare systems have been using Internet of Things (IoT) technologies for gathering sensor data for diagnosing the heart disease and prognosis in recent years. Researchers have focused a lot of emphasis on diagnosing heart disease, although the outcomes are not always reliable. This article proposes the automated heart disease prediction model with three main stages, including preprocessing, feature extraction, and prediction. The input data undergoes an improved Z-score normalization as the preprocessing step. The appropriate features needed to train the prediction model are retrieved from the preprocessed data during feature extraction. The features extracted include improved entropy, statistical features, and information gain features. Depends on the features extracted, prediction is determined by the Improved Quantum CNN (IQCNN). The results of the IQCNN are compared to earlier systems for a various metrics. The proposed IQCNN model has achieved better accuracy of 0.91 at a 70% learning rate when evaluated over conventional methods like Bi-LSTM, CNN, QCNN, DNN, NN, RNN, MDCNN and E-KNN for better performance in the prediction of heart disease. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - Cardiovascular diseases, particularly arrhythmias, remain a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis plays a pivotal role in cardiovascular disease diagnosis. Although previous studies have focused on waveform analysis and model training, integrating additional clinical information, especially demographic data, remains challenging. In this study, we present an innovative approach to ECG classification by incorporating demographic information from patients’ medical histories through a colorization technique. Our proposed method maps demographic features onto the (R, G, B) color space through normalized scaling. Each demographic feature corresponds to a distinct color, allowing for different ECG leads to be colored. This approach preserves the relationships between data by maintaining the color correlations in the statistical features, enhancing ECG analytics and supporting precision medicine. We conducted experiments with PTB-XL dataset and achieved 1%–6% improvements in the area under the receiving operator characteristic curve performance compared with other methods for various classification problems. Notably, our method excelled in multiclass and challenging classification tasks. The combined use of color features and the original waveform shape features enhanced prediction accuracy for various deep learning models. Our findings suggest that colorization is a promising avenue for advancing ECG classification and diagnosis, contributing to improved prediction and diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases and ultimately enhancing clinical outcomes. © 2024

N2  - Cardiovascular diseases are the main cause of death in the world and cardiovascular imaging techniques are the mainstay of noninvasive diagnosis. Aortic stenosis is a lethal cardiac disease preceded by aortic valve calcification for several years. Data-driven tools developed with Deep Learning (DL) algorithms can process and categorize medical images data, providing fast diagnoses with considered reliability, to improve healthcare effectiveness. A systematic review of DL applications on medical images for pathologic calcium detection concluded that there are established techniques in this field, using primarily CT scans, at the expense of radiation exposure. Echocardiography is an unexplored alternative to detect calcium, but still needs technological developments. In this article, a fully automated method based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) was developed to detect Aortic Calcification in Echocardiography images, consisting of two essential processes: (1) an object detector to locate aortic valve – achieving 95% of precision and 100% of recall; and (2) a classifier to identify calcium structures in the valve – which achieved 92% of precision and 100% of recall. The outcome of this work is the possibility of automation of the detection with Echocardiography of Aortic Valve Calcification, a lethal and prevalent disease. © The Author(s) 2024.

N2  - Cardiovascular disease can be caused by a variety of factors. Researchers can predict cardiovascular infirmity using a variety of methods, regardless of whether a person has the condition or not. The heart disease has been placed via extracting significant qualities and most relevant features using a variety of research methods, such as pulse, cholesterol levels, and other symptoms. The major goal of the study is to use the data to forecast whether the person has a cardiovascular condition. As a result, data mining is employed, which makes it simple to analyse the data collection. Null values and duplicate values are eliminated. The data is subjected to regression analyses utilising decision trees with party and rpart, random forests, linear regression, and logistic regression. The data set is trained and tested using regressions. The regressions are compared, and the outcome for the data set is reliable. All comparisons within the data set are then made using the regression. Therefore, the findings indicate whether or not the individual will eventually develop cardiovascular disease. © 2024, Auricle Global Society of Education and Research. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a global demand for intelligent health surveillance and diagnosis systems for patients with critical conditions, particularly those with severe heart diseases. Sophisticated measurement tools are used in hospitals worldwide to identify serious heart conditions. However, these tools need the face-to-face involvement of healthcare experts to identify cardiac problems. Objective: To design and implement an intelligent health monitoring and diagnosis system for critical cardiac arrhythmia COVID-19 patients. Methodology: We use artificial intelligence tools divided into two parts: (i) IoT-based health monitoring; and (ii) fuzzy logic-based medical diagnosis. The intelligent diagnosis of heart conditions and IoT-based health surveillance by doctors is offered to critical COVID-19 patients or isolated in remote locations. Sensors, cloud storage, as well as a global system for mobile texts and emails for communication with doctors in case of emergency are employed in our proposal. Results: Our implemented system favors remote areas and isolated critical patients. This system utilizes an intelligent algorithm that employs an ECG signal pre-processed by moving through six digital filters. Then, based on the processed results, features are computed and assessed. The intelligent fuzzy system can make an autonomous diagnosis and has enough information to avoid human intervention. The algorithm is trained using ECG data from the MIT-BIH database and achieves high accuracy. In real-time validation, the fuzzy algorithm obtained almost 100% accuracy for all experiments. Conclusion: Our intelligent system can be helpful in many situations, but it is particularly beneficial for isolated COVID-19 patients who have critical heart arrhythmia and must receive intensive care. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - Cardiovascular disease is the primary reason for mortality worldwide, responsible for around a third of all deaths. To assist medical professionals in quickly identifying and diagnosing patients, numerous machine learning and data mining techniques are utilized to predict the disease. Many researchers have developed various models to boost the efficiency of these predictions. Feature selection and extraction techniques are utilized to remove unnecessary features from the dataset, thereby reducing computation time and increasing the efficiency of the models. In this study, we introduce a new ensemble Quine McCluskey Binary Classifier (QMBC) technique for identifying patients diagnosed with some form of heart disease and those who are not diagnosed. The QMBC model utilizes an ensemble of seven models, including logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, K-nearest neighbour, naive bayes, support vector machine, and multilayer perceptron, and performs exceptionally well on binary class datasets. We employ feature selection and feature extraction techniques to accelerate the prediction process. We utilize Chi-Square and ANOVA approaches to identify the top 10 features and create a subset of the dataset. We then apply Principal Component Analysis to the subset to identify 9 prime components. We utilize an ensemble of all seven models and the Quine McCluskey technique to obtain the Minimum Boolean expression for the target feature. The results of the seven models ( x_0, x_1, x_2,⋖, x_6 ) are considered independent features, while the target attribute is dependent. We combine the projected outcomes of the seven ML models and the target feature to form a foaming dataset. We apply the ensemble model to the dataset, utilizing the Quine McCluskey minimum Boolean equation built with an 80:20 train-to-test ratio. Our proposed QMBC model surpasses all current state-of-the-art models and previously suggested methods put forward by various researchers. © 2013 IEEE.

N2  - Background Rapid coronary plaque progression (RPP) is associated with incident cardiovascular events. To date, no method exists for the identification of individuals at risk of RPP at a single point in time. This study integrated coronary computed tomography angiography-determined qualitative and quantitative plaque features within a machine learning (ML) framework to determine its performance for predicting RPP. Methods and Results Qualitative and quantitative coronary computed tomography angiography plaque characterization was performed in 1083 patients who underwent serial coronary computed tomography angiography from the PARADIGM (Progression of Atherosclerotic Plaque Determined by Computed Tomographic Angiography Imaging) registry. RPP was defined as an annual progression of percentage atheroma volume ≥1.0%. We employed the following ML models: model 1, clinical variables; model 2, model 1 plus qualitative plaque features; model 3, model 2 plus quantitative plaque features. ML models were compared with the atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk score, Duke coronary artery disease score, and a logistic regression statistical model. 224 patients (21%) were identified as RPP. Feature selection in ML identifies that quantitative computed tomography variables were higher-ranking features, followed by qualitative computed tomography variables and clinical/laboratory variables. ML model 3 exhibited the highest discriminatory performance to identify individuals who would experience RPP when compared with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk score, the other ML models, and the statistical model (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve in ML model 3, 0.83 [95% CI 0.78-0.89], versus atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk score, 0.60 [0.52-0.67]; Duke coronary artery disease score, 0.74 [0.68-0.79]; ML model 1, 0.62 [0.55-0.69]; ML model 2, 0.73 [0.67-0.80]; all P<0.001; statistical model, 0.81 [0.75-0.87], P=0.128). Conclusions Based on a ML framework, quantitative atherosclerosis characterization has been shown to be the most important feature when compared with clinical, laboratory, and qualitative measures in identifying patients at risk of RPP.

N2  - Background and Objective: Cardiac arrhythmia, which is an abnormal heart rhythm, is a common clinical problem in cardiology. Arrhythmias can be divided into many Categories, and accurate detection of arrhythmias can effectively prevent heart disease and reduce mortality. However, existing screening methods require long time monitoring and are low cost and low yield. Our goal is to develop a mixed depth model for processing time series to predict multi-classification electrocardiograph (ECG). Methods: In this study, we developed a new, more robust network model named Hybrid Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (HCRNet) for the time-series signal of ECG. This model utilized a nine-class ECG dataset containing tens of thousands of data to automatically detect cardiac arrhythmias. At the same time, a large imbalance arose because some of the cases in our selected MIT-BIH atrial fibrillation database had less than 100 records, but some had more than 10,000 records. Therefore, during data preprocessing, we adopted a scientific and efficient method to solve the ECG data imbalance problem. In the experimental studies, 10-fold cross validation technique is employed to evaluate performance of the model. Results: In order to fully validate our proposed model, we conducted a comprehensive experiment to investigate the performance of the proposed method. Our proposed HCRNet achieved the average accuracy of 99.01% performance and the average sensitivity of 99.58% performance on this dataset. Results suggest that the proposed model outperformed some state-of-the-art studies in ECG classification with a high overall performance value. Conclusion: The HCRNet model can effectively classify arrhythmia signals in nine categories and obtain high efficiency, accuracy and F1 values. These improvements in efficiency and accuracy explain the rationality and science of setting up the modules in the HCRNet. By using this model, it can help cardiologists to correctly identify heartbeat types and perform arrhythmia diagnosis quickly. © 2021

N2  - Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is an important cardiac rhythm disorder, which if left untreated can lead to serious complications such as a stroke. AF can remain asymptomatic, and it can progressively worsen over time; it is thus a disorder that would benefit from detection and continuous monitoring with a wearable sensor. We develop an AF detection algorithm, deploy it on a smartwatch, and prospectively and comprehensively validate its performance on a real-world population that included patients diagnosed with AF. The algorithm showed a sensitivity of 87.8% and a specificity of 97.4% over every 5-minute segment of PPG evaluated. Furthermore, we introduce novel algorithm blocks and system designs to increase the time of coverage and monitor for AF even during periods of motion noise and other artifacts that would be encountered in daily-living scenarios. An average of 67.8% of the entire duration the patients wore the smartwatch produced a valid decision. Finally, we present the ability of our algorithm to function throughout the day and estimate the AF burden, a first-of-this-kind measure using a wearable sensor, showing 98% correlation with the ground truth and an average error of 6.2%. © 2013 IEEE.

N2  - Summary Background Left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) is independently associated with cardiovascular events in patients with congenital heart disease. Although artificial intelligence-enhanced electrocardiogram (AI-ECG) analysis is predictive of LVSD in the general adult population, it has yet to be applied comprehensively across congenital heart disease lesions. Methods We trained a convolutional neural network on paired ECG–echocardiograms (≤2 days apart) across the lifespan of a wide range of congenital heart disease lesions to detect left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 40% or less. Model performance was evaluated on single ECG–echocardiogram pairs per patient at Boston Children's Hospital (Boston, MA, USA) and externally at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (Philadelphia, PA, USA) using area under the receiver operating (AUROC) and precision-recall (AUPRC) curves. Findings The training cohort comprised 124 265 ECG–echocardiogram pairs (49 158 patients; median age 10·5 years [IQR 3·5–16·8]; 3381 [2·7%] of 124 265 ECG–echocardiogram pairs with LVEF ≤40%). Test groups included internal testing (21 068 patients; median age 10·9 years [IQR 3·7–17·0]; 3381 [2·7%] of 124 265 ECG–echocardiogram pairs with LVEF ≤40%) and external validation (42 984 patients; median age 10·8 years [IQR 4·9–15·0]; 1313 [1·7%] of 76 400 ECG–echocardiogram pairs with LVEF ≤40%) cohorts. High model performance was achieved during internal testing (AUROC 0·95, AUPRC 0·33) and external validation (AUROC 0·96, AUPRC 0·25) for a wide range of congenital heart disease lesions. Patients with LVEF greater than 40% by echocardiogram who were deemed high risk by AI-ECG were more likely to have future dysfunction compared with low-risk patients (hazard ratio 12·1 [95% CI 8·4–17·3]; p<0·0001). High-risk patients by AI-ECG were at increased risk of mortality in the overall cohort and lesion-specific subgroups. Common salient features highlighted across congenital heart disaese lesions include precordial QRS complexes and T waves, with common high-risk ECG features including deep V2 S waves and lateral precordial T wave inversion. A case study on patients with ventricular pacing showed similar findings. Interpretation Our externally validated algorithm shows promise in prediction of current and future LVSD in patients with congenital heart disease, providing a clinically impactful, inexpensive, and convenient cardiovascular health tool in this population.

N2  - The study focuses on automating ECG analysis, a crucial tool for cardiac evaluation and treatment decisions. Two classifiers were developed to detect cardiac conduction disorders and myocardial infarctions from 12-lead ECGs. These classifiers were trained on three open datasets after ECG preprocessing to remove noise and select relevant features. The first classifier (10 classes) identifies conditions of the ventricular conduction system: normal ECG, LBBB, ILBBB, premature ventricular complex, LAFB, LPFB, IRBBB, RBBB, nonspecific intraventricular conduction disturbance, and ventricular preexcitation. The second classifier (5 classes) distinguishes between non-infarcted ECGs and various types of myocardial infarction locations. For each QRS complex, we calculated statistical, time-domain, frequency features, and scalograms. Then we trained classifiers combining XGBoost for statistical features, an autoencoder+neural network for deep-learning features, and ResNet for scalograms. An ensemble approach was employed to get the final class prediction. We show that the developed ensemble model achieve the mean F1-score of 0.70 and 0.76 for the first and second classifier respectively. The study's key strength lies in its diverse feature extraction methods, enhancing the predictive power of machine learning models. © 2023 CinC.

N2  - For consideration of uncertainties of a medicine dataset, a new conceptual architecture fuzzy three-valued logic is introduced in this research work. The proposed concept is applied to the heart disease dataset for the assessment of heart disease risk in individuals. By comparison of three binary (0,1) input variables, the variables' uncertainties and their collective impact can be analyzed that provide complete information leading to better outcome prediction. The availability of a wide range of values ultimately modified the output binary variable thus now providing three values (0,0.5,1) instead of binary (0,1) values. The three types of output values are heart disease risk is absent (0), may be present (0.5), and present (1). The inclusion of an additional class which is heart disease risk may be present (0.5) can alert an individual to include healthy lifestyle factors to minimize any chances of the presence of risk of heart disease development due to the behavioral risk factors at least thus helping an individual for better decision making. Initially, a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) i.e. traditional machine learning techniques have been applied to the considered dataset. Subsequently, it is applied to the fuzzy three-valued modified considered dataset hence leading to the development of a hybrid fuzzy three-valued modified machine learning model. This integration increases the accuracy of machine learning techniques from 70 % to 99 %. Likewise, the computation time has also been optimized and provides results in less than 11s. Statistical analysis using the Wilcoxon signed rank test and validation using an application of the proposed method on datasets of different domains also depicts that the proposed methodology is better and computationally efficient. Moreover, it also provides sufficient information to the individual thus helping in better decision making to live a disease free life.

N2  - Cardiovascular disease is a major cause of death worldwide, and the COVID-19 pandemic has only made the situation worse. The purpose of this work is to explore various time-frequency analysis methods that can be used to classify heart sound signals and identify multiple abnormalities in the heart, such as aortic stenosis, mitral stenosis, and mitral valve prolapse. The signal has been modified using three techniques - tunable quality wavelet transform (TQWT), discrete wavelet transform (DWT), and empirical mode decomposition - to detect heart signal abnormality. The proposed model detects heart signal abnormality at two stages, the user end and the clinical end. At the user end, binary classification of signals is performed, and if signals are abnormal then further classification is done at the clinic. The approach starts with signal preprocessing and uses the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) coefficients to train the hybrid model, which consists of one long short-term memory (LSTM) network layer and three convolutional neural network (CNN) layers. This method produced comparable results, with a 98.9% classification accuracy for signals, through the utilization of the CNN and LSTM model. Combining the CNN's skill in feature extraction with the LSTM's capacity to record time-dependent features improves the efficacy of the model. Identifying issues early and initiating appropriate medication can alleviate the burden associated with heart valve diseases. © 2024 Ravi Raj Choudhary et al.

N2  - Heart diseases remain one of the leading causes of death worldwide. As a result, early and accurate diagnostics have become an urgent need for treatment and management. Most of the conventional methods adopted tend to have major drawbacks: the issues of accuracy, interpretability, and feature representation. This work, therefore, proposes CardioSenseNet, which may provide a new framework that can improve accuracy and efficiency in heart disease detection. Firstly, the approach introduces a few new methods: DGPN for data preprocessing, STHIO for feature selection, and SADNet for prediction. DGPN normalizes the data depending on the distribution characteristic, which improves the quality of the feature representation. STHIO adopts the Sheep Flock Optimization method for the exploration of features and Tuna Swarm Optimization for the exploitation of features, guaranteeing the optimality in feature selection. SADNet is one such deep learning model that tries to find the complicated pattern in high-dimensional data for better prediction accuracy. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets such as Cleveland and CVD endorse the efficiency of CardioSenseNet with a high accuracy of 99 % and at an minimum loss of 0.12 %. The results thus indicate that CardioSenseNet is a promising solution for the detection of heart diseases with high accuracy and at an early stage; therefore, it will contribute significantly to cardiovascular healthcare developments.

N2  - Stroke and cerebral haemorrhage are the second leading causes of death in the world after ischaemic heart disease. In this work, a dataset containing medical, physiological and environmental tests for stroke was used to evaluate the efficacy of machine learning, deep learning and a hybrid technique between deep learning and machine learning on theMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) dataset for cerebral haemorrhage. In the first dataset (medical records), two features, namely, diabetes and obesity, were created on the basis of the values of the corresponding features. The t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding algorithm was applied to represent the high-dimensional dataset in a low-dimensional data space. Meanwhile, the Recursive Feature Elimination algorithm (RFE) was applied to rank the features according to priority and their correlation to the target feature and to remove the unimportant features. The features are fed into the various classification algorithms, namely, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Multilayer Perceptron. All algorithms achieved superior results. The Random Forest algorithm achieved the best performance amongst the algorithms; it reached an overall accuracy of 99%. This algorithm classified stroke cases with Precision, Recall and F1 score of 98%, 100% and 99%, respectively. In the second dataset, the MRI image dataset was evaluated by using the AlexNet model and AlexNet+SVM hybrid technique. The hybrid model AlexNet+SVM performed is better than the AlexNet model; it reached accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 99.9%, 100%, 99.80% and 99.86%, respectively. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

N2  - Over the past few decades, substantial progress has been made in the field of liver transplantation. Yet, challenges remain in the field due to an increasing organ allograft shortage as well as significant waitlist mortality. With these challenges, organ allocation policies have been developed and are constantly being modified to result in more efficient organ allocation. One tool that has been explored to improve the field of liver transplantation is artificial intelligence, which is an umbrella term for techniques such as machine learning and deep learning. This review article explores the use of artificial intelligence in the field of liver transplantation. Specifically, studies have shown potential applications of artificial intelligence in improving waitlist mortality models, assessing allograft characteristics, using large language models for research question development and patient education, developing post-transplant models, as well as predicting multiple risk factors such as cardiovascular disease, infection, graft failure, malignancy, graft fibrosis, and pneumonia. However, even with these studies, several limitations for the use of artificial intelligence exist such as biased data sets leading to biased model development, lack of extensive validation of the artificial intelligence models, and the need for large datasets for model development. With additional studies evaluating the use of artificial intelligence and wide-scale validation of these studies highlighted, the use of artificial intelligence may transform the field of transplantation in the future.

N2  - The accurate prediction of heart disease is essential to efficiently treating cardiac patients before a heart attack occurs. This goal can be achieved using an optimal machine learning model with rich healthcare data on heart diseases. Various systems based on machine learning have been presented recently to predict and diagnose heart disease. However, these systems cannot handle high-dimensional datasets due to the lack of a smart framework that can use different sources of data for heart disease prediction. In addition, the existing systems utilize conventional techniques to select features from a dataset and compute a general weight for them based on their significance. These methods have also failed to enhance the performance of heart disease diagnosis. In this paper, a smart healthcare system is proposed for heart disease prediction using ensemble deep learning and feature fusion approaches. First, the feature fusion method combines the extracted features from both sensor data and electronic medical records to generate valuable healthcare data. Second, the information gain technique eliminates irrelevant and redundant features, and selects the important ones, which decreases the computational burden and enhances the system performance. In addition, the conditional probability approach computes a specific feature weight for each class, which further improves system performance. Finally, the ensemble deep learning model is trained for heart disease prediction. The proposed system is evaluated with heart disease data and compared with traditional classifiers based on feature fusion, feature selection, and weighting techniques. The proposed system obtains accuracy of 98.5%, which is higher than existing systems. This result shows that our system is more effective for the prediction of heart disease, in comparison to other state-of-the-art methods. © 2020

N2  - In this paper, we propose chimp optimization algorithm (ChOA) for selection of feature to increase the classification accuracy of heart disease diagnosis. In this approach, noises contained in the cardiac image are removed using median filter initially. Then, GLCM features are extracted from the cardiac image. Among the extracted features, optimal features are chosen using ChOA algorithm. These selected features taken as input to the classifier. In this approach, support vector neural network (SVNN) is used as classifier. The classifier classifies the image into normal and abnormal. Simulation results depict that the ChOA-based SVNN performs superior than the conventional SVNN, ANN, KNN and SVM in terms of accuracy. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

N2  - A comprehensive study was conducted to differentiate cardiovascular disease (CVD) subjects from non-CVD subjects using short recording electrocardiogram (ECG) of 244 Malaysian adults in The Malaysian Cohort project.An automated peak detection algorithm to detect nine fiducial points of electrocardiogram (ECG) was developed. Forty-eight features were extracted in both time and frequency domains, including statistical features obtained from heart rate variability and Poincare plot analysis. These include five new features derived from spectrum counts of five different frequency ranges. Feature selection was then made based on p-value and correlation matrix. Selected features were used as input for five classifiers of artificial neural network (ANN), k-nearest neighbors (kNN), support vector machine (SVM), discriminant analysis (DA), and decision tree (DT). Results showed that six features related to Twavewere statistically significant in distinguishing CVD and non-CVD groups. ANN had performed the best with 94.44% specificity and 86.3% accuracy, followed by kNN with 80.56% specificity, 86.49% sensitivity and 83.56% accuracy. The novelties of this study were in providing alternative solutions to detect P-onset, P-offset, T-offset as well as QRS-onset points using discrete wavelet transform method. Additionally, two out of the five newly proposed spectral features were significant in differentiating both groups, at frequency ranges of 1-10 Hz and 5-10 Hz. The prediction outcomes were also comparable to previous related studies and significantly important in using ECG to predict cardiac-related events among CVD and non-CVD subjects in the Malaysian population. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

N2  - Objective: We present a novel method for detecting atrial fibrillation (AFib) by analyzing Lead II electrocardiograms (ECGs) using a unique set of features. Methods: For this purpose, we used specific signal processing techniques, such as proper orthogonal decomposition, continuous wavelet transforms, discrete cosine transform, and standard cross-correlation, to extract 48 features from the ECGs. Thus, our approach aims to more effectively capture AFib signatures, such as beat-to-beat variability and fibrillatory waves, than traditional metrics. Moreover, our features were designed to be physiologically interpretable. Subsequently, we incorporated an XGBoost-based ECG classifier to train and evaluate it using the publicly available ‘Training’ dataset of the 2017 PhysioNet Challenge, which includes ‘Normal,’ ‘AFib,’ ‘Other,’ and ‘Noisy’ ECG categories. Results: Our method achieved an accuracy of 96 % and an F1-score of 0.83 for ‘AFib’ detection and 80 % accuracy and 0.85 F1-score for ‘Normal’ ECGs. Finally, we compared our method's performance with the top-classifiers from the 2017 PhysioNet Challenge, namely ENCASE, Random Forest, and Cascaded Binary. As reported by Clifford et al., 2017, these three best performing models scored 0.80, 0.83, 0.82, in terms of F1-score for ‘AFib’ detection, respectively. Conclusion: Despite using significantly fewer features than the competition's state-of-the-art ECG detection algorithms (48 vs. 150–622), our model achieved a comparable F1-score of 0.83 for successful ‘AFib’ detection. Significance: The interpretable features specifically designed for ‘AFib’ detection results in our method's adaptability in clinical settings for real-time arrhythmia detection and is even effective with short ECGs (<10 heartbeats). © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - Coronary heart disease or cardiovascular disease is a kind of heart disease that affects the heart and all the blood vessels in the body caused by a build-up of plaque in a person's arteries and can result in a stroke or heart attack. According to the Indonesian Ministry of Health, (Depkes RI) coronary heart disease is the main and first cause of all deaths by heart disease, which account for 26.4% among all other causes. Considering the severity of the condition, it is necessary to detect this kind of heart disease to reduce the number of deaths from heart disease. Heart disease detection can be performed by checking the Heart Rate Variability (HRV) signal. HRV assessment is carried out by analyzing short-term and long-term Electrocardiogram (ECG) records. To analyze HRV signals, a Higher-Order Moments Detrended Fluctuation Analysis feature extraction method is proposed to see the non-linear structure of HRV data. The input for Higher-Order Moments Detrended Fluctuation Analysis is an ECG signal which has been converted into an HRV signal. The output of the feature extraction shows that the value of kurtosis-based fluctuation function has a statistical significance in order to differentiate the HRV of heart disease patients and that of normal subjects. These values are then used as the input for classification using an Artificial Neural Network. The output of the classification is the classification of patients with heart disease and normal subjects. The results of the Higher-Order Moments Detrended Fluctuation Analysis feature extraction classification yield the best accuracy of 71.43% with a ROC value of 0.774 which can be categorized as a pretty good classification. © 2023 The Authors.

N2  - One among the major causes of death in the country is Heart disease (HD). 17.3 million deaths per year are caused by cardiac diseases, which is the primary reason for death in the globe as per the World Health Organization (WHO). Hence, the early detection of heart disease increases the survival rate. For an efficient detection of HD, a wide variety of techniques are used. But, the techniques rely on limited data; this degrades the accuracy and the performance of the model. So, to deal with these shortcomings, this paper has proposed Gaussian Kaiming Variance-based Deep Learning Neural Network (GKVDLNN) classifier for HD. In this study, the problem of heart disease detection using ECG and PCG signals is investigated, which provides valuable information about heart function. Thereby, the possible abnormalities of the heart are identified. Moreover, large data are used in this work to ensure the model’s accuracy. Firstly, from the publically accessible dataset, the input ECG along with PCG signals is gathered. Next, pre-processing is undergone by both signals. Utilizing Improved Empirical Mode Decomposition (IEMD), the signals are decomposed into bands after pre-processing. Then, for extracting the signal features, the decomposed bands are utilized. Then, for further process, the most suitable features are chosen as of the extracted features of both the ECG and PCG signals. After that, both the features are concatenated, and then classification is performed. In the classification process, the HD’s type is identified and classified by GKVDLNN. Experimental results stated the proposed model’s superiority and the proposed system withstands with 96.103% of accuracy with reduced costs. Overall, the method highlights the importance of early heart disease detection [32, 33] and provides a novel approach for achieving this goal through the integration of ECG and PCG signals with advanced signal processing and machine learning techniques [31]. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.

N2  - Diagnosing common noncommunicable diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes, typically relies on blood sample analysis for biomarker measurement. This process is invasive, time-consuming, and relatively expensive. To address these limitations, deep learning methods were leveraged to estimate common cardiometabolic biomarkers using retinal fundus (RF) images. The study utilized 15,802 RF images from 5,653 participants in the Qatar Biobank (QBB), leading to the development of 19 deep-learning models to estimate biomarkers across seven categories: demographics and body composition, blood pressure, lipid profile, blood profile, hormones, kidney function, and metabolites. The proposed model outperformed existing models for the QBB-specific cohort across all biomarkers, achieving higher R-squared (R2) values, lower mean absolute error (MAE), and higher area under the curve (AUC). The proposed model achieved excellent performance in demographic predictions with age (MAE: 2.56, R2: 0.93) and gender (Accuracy: 96%, AUC: 0.94). For cardiovascular markers, it showed moderate predictability with systolic blood pressure (MAE: 8.02, R2: 0.49) and diastolic blood pressure (MAE: 6.06, R2: 0.45). For metabolic markers, the model demonstrated varying performance, with hemoglobin showing strong prediction (MAE: 0.79, R2: 0.60) while lipid markers showed moderate performance (total cholesterol MAE: 0.63, R2: 0.29). For creatinine, a kidney function marker, we achieved the best results with MAE: 9.00, R2: 0.33. Stratified analyses revealed systematic performance variations across gender, age, and disease-specific subgroups, with better predictions in males, young-agers, and non-diabetic participants. External validation of the CAD group confirms the effect of age, gender, and disease on prediction results, suggesting the need for personalized background in consideration for developing AI models. This study presents a promising approach for non-invasive biomarker estimation using retinal images, potentially revolutionizing early intervention and treatment planning in healthcare.

N2  - This article uses a machine learning approach to analyze and detect burst signals in a smart healthcare system to protect and safeguard the public health. We consider the time-series electrocardiogram (ECG) waveforms for the detection of burst signals. For this purpose, we propose an intelligent differential correlation burst detection (DCBD) approach by establishing a mathematical model and deriving the analytical expressions to detect false alarm rate and missed detection rate in ECG signals. DCBD feeds the burst signals of a large-scale ECG waveform into various filters for noise removal, which are then passed through data augmentation to achieve high specificity and sensitivity. These waveforms are then segmented for feature extraction and machine learning (ML) classification. Finally, burst-free ECG waveforms are broadcast to a database server, where ML algorithms are used to detect the presence of any abnormal activities. Furthermore, the ECG signal is classified to a set of heart diseases using the well-known LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) models. Our proposed approach highlights that the probability of false alarm rate is similar to that caused by pure noise within the ECG waveforms. Our evaluation, using numerical experiments, suggests that the accuracy of the LSTM based ECG signal classification could be approximately 11.7% and 12.8% improved, subsequently, using the proposed burst detection method. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Heart-related illnesses, often known as cardiovascular diseases, have been the leading cause of mortality globally over the past several decades and are now recognized as the most major illness in both India and the rest of the globe. The severity out of the disease can be avoided with proper care at proper stage. This disease claims early and accurate prediction to avoid causalities. As proper medical support is not adequate, diseases are not being identified at the proper time and treatment cannot be started. Machine learning algorithms have shown promise in predicting heart disease risk based on patient data. In this study, a machine learning-based heart disease prediction model has been presented. The objective of the work is to build a machine learning-based model for early and adequate prediction of heart disease. The proposed model has utilized support vector machine and artificial intelligence with an accuracy of 81.6% and 86.6%, respectively. The findings show that the model predicts heart disease risk with excellent accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, offering healthcare professionals a useful tool to pinpoint people who may be more at risk of developing heart disease. © The Author(s) 2023.

N2  - As part of a real-time cardiac monitoring system based on artificial intelligence, automatic analysis and classification of electrocardiographic (ECG) signals enables early detection of cardiac arrhythmias and myocardial infarction. Rapid, accurate diagnosis is a major factor in patient prognosis. Manual diagnosis of ECG signals remains a complex task. To avoid this challenge, deep learning models based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) have been developed. These models were trained and validated on public ECG databases annotated by cardiologists, such as the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database and the PTB Diagnostic ECG Database. The results obtained from the model (CNN and RNN), with an accuracy of 98.1% compared to the separate model, are more than encouraging. The results obtained by this model are highly promising for the diagnosis of heart disease.

N2  - The diagnosis and prognosis of cardiovascular disease are crucial medical tasks to ensure correct classification, which helps cardiologists provide proper treatment to the patient. Machine learning applications in the medical niche have increased as they can recognize patterns from data. Using machine learning to classify cardiovascular disease occurrence can help diagnosticians reduce misdiagnosis. This research develops a model that can correctly predict cardiovascular diseases to reduce the fatality caused by cardiovascular diseases. This paper proposes a method of k-modes clustering with Huang starting that can improve classification accuracy. Models such as random forest (RF), decision tree classifier (DT), multilayer perceptron (MP), and XGBoost (XGB) are used. GridSearchCV was used to hypertune the parameters of the applied model to optimize the result. The proposed model is applied to a real-world dataset of 70,000 instances from Kaggle. Models were trained on data that were split in 80:20 and achieved accuracy as follows: decision tree: 86.37% (with cross-validation) and 86.53% (without cross-validation), XGBoost: 86.87% (with cross-validation) and 87.02% (without cross-validation), random forest: 87.05% (with cross-validation) and 86.92% (without cross-validation), multilayer perceptron: 87.28% (with cross-validation) and 86.94% (without cross-validation). The proposed models have AUC (area under the curve) values: decision tree: 0.94, XGBoost: 0.95, random forest: 0.95, multilayer perceptron: 0.95. The conclusion drawn from this underlying research is that multilayer perceptron with cross-validation has outperformed all other algorithms in terms of accuracy. It achieved the highest accuracy of 87.28%. © 2023 by the authors.

N2  - Background Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is a reference-standard modality for heart diseases, although its clinical application is restricted by prolonged acquisition times. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI), particularly deep learning (DL), has exhibited the potential to accelerate the CMR acquisition through technological advances. Prospective validation of its diagnostic performance across multiple clinical sequences remains underexplored. This research aims to assess the functions of the compressed sensing artificial intelligence (CSAI) algorithm in accelerating CMR acquisition, enhancing image quality, and maintaining diagnostic accuracy versus conventional sensitivity encoding (SENSE) reconstruction. Methods A total of 105 participants scheduled for clinical CMR between February and August 2024 underwent both SENSE and CSAI-accelerated sequences containing Cine, T2 short TI inversion recovery (STIR), and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) during a single session. The subjective image quality was assessed by a 5-point Likert scale. Quantitative image quality metrics were evaluated including SNR, CNR, edge sharpness, ventricular function, T2 signal intensity (SI) ratio, and LGE percentage. Results Using standard resolution, the acquisition time of CSAI-CMR was 57.4% lower than that of SENSE CMR (159.2 ± 22.4seconds vs 277.1 ± 30.4seconds; P <.001). Higher subjective scores could be found in CSAI-Cine and CSAI-T2 STIR compared with SENSE CMR (P <.001). Quantitative analyses demonstrated superior SNR and CNR across CSAI sequences in comparison with SENSE-CMR including Cine (SNR: 109.16 ± 20.36 vs. 102.52 ± 21.93, CNR: 58.98 ± 24.43 vs. 51.08 ± 23.37; both P<.001), T2 STIR (SNR: 98.17 ± 6.20 vs. 81.77 ± 11.15; P<.001), and LGE (SNR: 38.02 ± 7.90 vs. 32.54 ± 7.72, CNR: 22.24 ± 5.15 vs. 19.09 ± 4.22; both P<.001). Edge sharpness was significantly improved by using CSAI-CMR (0.141 ± 0.06 pixel⁻¹ vs 0.105 ± 0.04 pixel⁻¹; P <.01). Functional parameters, both T2 SI ratio and LGE percentage were comparable relatively (all P >.05). Conclusion DL reconstruction of CMR sequences reduced acquisition times by 57% and enhanced image quality compared to conventional SENSE reconstruction, while maintaining consistent quantitative parameters and diagnostic accuracy across all sequences. These results advocate integrating DL-accelerated workflows into clinical practice.

N2  - This study proposes a novel Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network (LSTM) architecture for the diagnosis of myocardial infarctions from individual heartbeats of single-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs). The proposed model is trained using an unbiased patient split approach and validated using 10-fold cross-validation over 148 myocardial infarction and 52 Healthy Control patients from the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt diagnostic ECG Database to generate an inter-patient classifier. We further demonstrate why special care must be taken when generating the training and testing datasets by exploring the effects of various data-split techniques that could mask the occurrence of overfitting and produce misleadingly high testing metrics of the model's performance. A thorough assessment of these results is provided using several standard metrics for different data split methods to show their tendency to overfitting, data leakage, and bias introduced from previously seen heart beats during the training phase. The design achieves near real-time diagnosis of 40 ms while providing an accuracy of 89.56% (with a 95% Confidence Interval (CI) of ±2.79%), recall/sensitivity of 91.88% (±3.13% 95%CI), and a specificity of 80.81% (±9.62% 95%CI). The fast processing makes the model readily deployable on currently existing mobile devices and testing instruments. The achieved performance makes the proposed method a new research direction for attaining real-time and unbiased diagnosis. While, the modular architectural design of the LSTM network structure, which is amenable for the inclusion of other ECG leads, could serve as a platform for early detection of myocardial infarction and for the planning of early treatment(s). © 2021

N2  - Cloud computing provides resources over the Internet and allows a plethora of applications to be deployed to provide services for different industries. The major bottleneck being faced currently in these cloud frameworks is their limited scalability and hence inability to cater to the requirements of centralized Internet of Things (IoT) based compute environments. The main reason for this is that latency-sensitive applications like health monitoring and surveillance systems now require computation over large amounts of data (Big Data) transferred to centralized database and from database to cloud data centers which leads to drop in performance of such systems. The new paradigms of fog and edge computing provide innovative solutions by bringing resources closer to the user and provide low latency and energy efficient solutions for data processing compared to cloud domains. Still, the current fog models have many limitations and focus from a limited perspective on either accuracy of results or reduced response time but not both. We proposed a novel framework called HealthFog for integrating ensemble deep learning in Edge computing devices and deployed it for a real-life application of automatic Heart Disease analysis. HealthFog delivers healthcare as a fog service using IoT devices and efficiently manages the data of heart patients, which comes as user requests. Fog-enabled cloud framework, FogBus is used to deploy and test the performance of the proposed model in terms of power consumption, network bandwidth, latency, jitter, accuracy and execution time. HealthFog is configurable to various operation modes which provide the best Quality of Service or prediction accuracy, as required, in diverse fog computation scenarios and for different user requirements. We released HealthFog as an open source software. The implementation code with experiment scripts and results can be found at the GitHub repository: https://github.com/Cloudslab/HealthFog

N2  - Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are among the most common serious illnesses affecting human health. CVDs may be prevented or mitigated by early diagnosis, and this may reduce mortality rates. Identifying risk factors using machine learning models is a promising approach. We would like to propose a model that incorporates different methods to achieve effective prediction of heart disease. For our proposed model to be successful, we have used efficient Data Collection, Data Pre-processing and Data Transformation methods to create accurate information for the training model. We have used a combined dataset (Cleveland, Long Beach VA, Switzerland, Hungarian and Stat log). Suitable features are selected by using the Relief, and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) techniques. New hybrid classifiers like Decision Tree Bagging Method (DTBM), Random Forest Bagging Method (RFBM), K-Nearest Neighbors Bagging Method (KNNBM), AdaBoost Boosting Method (ABBM), and Gradient Boosting Boosting Method (GBBM) are developed by integrating the traditional classifiers with bagging and boosting methods, which are used in the training process. We have also instrumented some machine learning algorithms to calculate the Accuracy (ACC), Sensitivity (SEN), Error Rate, Precision (PRE) and F1 Score (F1) of our model, along with the Negative Predictive Value (NPR), False Positive Rate (FPR), and False Negative Rate (FNR). The results are shown separately to provide comparisons. Based on the result analysis, we can conclude that our proposed model produced the highest accuracy while using RFBM and Relief feature selection methods (99.05%). © 2013 IEEE.

N2  - Cardiovascular diseases, popularly known as heart disease leading to heart attack, kill nearly 17.9 million humans. Heart disease is found in three out of five patients in critical care unit. The complexity of this disease lies in the fact that it suddenly fails the functioning of human and then Standard Operating Plan (SOP) is required; if not provided on time, patients’ life is in danger. Proper healthcare system takes time to detect the cause and effectively start the diagnosis, whereas our proposed system efficiently and accurately tells the client weather a patient has a heart disease or not. It also tells whether the patient will face such kind of disease in near future or not. The system is developed based on machine learning techniques such as Naive Bayes, XGBoost gradient classifier, support vector machine (SVM), and decision tree. Some external factors were also considered which may lead to heart disease in the future. Furthermore, integrated web application has been developed which alert and gives a user-friendly interface for the recognition and prediction. Thirteen diagnostic factors and five environmental factors are analyzed. The proposed diagnosis system attained a good precision as compared to previous methods recommended earlier. In addition, system can easily be implemented in public domain to spread awareness regarding heart disease, and it also talks about the possibility of the heart disease in near future. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

N2  - Many patients at high risk of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias (VA) and sudden cardiac death (SCD) who received an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), never receive appropriate device therapy. The presence of fibrosis on LGE CMR imaging is shown to be associated with increased risk of VA. Therefore, there is a strong need for both automatic segmentation and quantification of cardiac fibrosis as well as better risk stratification for SCD. This study first presents a novel two-stage deep learning network for the segmentation of left ventricle myocardium and fibrosis on LGE CMR images. Secondly it aims to effectively predict device therapy in ICD patients by using a graph neural network approach which incorporates both myocardium and fibrosis features as well as the left ventricle geometry. Our segmentation network outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on 2D CMR data, reaching a Dice score of 0.82 and 0.77 on myocardium and fibrosis segmentation, respectively. The ICD therapy prediction network reaches an AUC of 0.60 while using only CMR data and outperforms baseline methods based on current guideline markers for ICD implantation. This work lays a strong basis for future research on improved risk stratification for VA and SCD. © 2022 Creative Commons.

N2  - Introduction Left atrial (LA) dilatation predicts several cardiovascular disorders. Identifying LA dilatation on computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) could aid diagnosis of cardiovascular disease. This study assessed an artificial intelligence (AI) segmentation model’s performance at detecting LA dilatation on CTPA. Methods Patients with suspected pulmonary hypertension (PH) who underwent CTPA and cardiac MRI (CMR) were retrospectively identified from a single centre registry. The LA was segmented by an AI tool for CTPA and a validated AI tool for CMR. LA volume measurements were categorised for LA dilatation based on existing threshold values. The expert radiologist's reports of the CTPA studies were also categorised for LA dilatation. Automated CTPA LA volumes and corresponding radiologist reports were compared against the reference standard of CMR. Results 451 patients were included (mean age 64 ± 13 years, 62.5 % female, 85.8 % white). Automated LA volume measurements on CTPA showed strong positive correlation with those on CMR (ρ = 0.92, p < 0.001) with minimal bias on Bland-Altman analysis (-4 mL, 95 %CI −39 to +31 mL). Automated LA measurements on CTPA showed higher agreement with those on CMR (κ = 0.80) than the radiologist reports (κ = 0.62). Automated LA measurements on CTPA showed higher accuracy metrics (sensitivity 81.0 %, specificity 96.8 %, positive predictive value (PPV) 88.5 %, negative predictive value (NPV) 94.4 %) than the radiologist reports (sensitivity 66.7 %, specificity 93.1 %, PPV 74.5 %, NPV 90.2 %). Conclusion Deep learning increases the accuracy of LA volume measurements on non-ECG gated CTPA, improving radiologist performance in detecting LA dilatation.

N2  - The advancement in medical diagnosis approaches increases the demand for effective disease prediction and classification system. Although, various machine learning (ML) based disease classification techniques were developed, they face severe issues. Hence, a novel optimized framework named as Wolf based Generative Adversarial System (WbGAS) system was designed to predict and specify the heart disease using Electrocardiogram (ECG) database. The collected dataset contains three classes namely Normal Sinus Rhythm (NSR), Arrhythmia (ARR), and Congestive Heart Failure (CHF). The dataset is initialized and trained using the proposed (WbGAS) approach to predict the normal and abnormal signals present in dataset. In addition, the integration of wolf fitness function in the presented approach provides finest prediction rate. Moreover, the type of heart disease is specified based on the trained features. Also, a case study was presented with three different cases to explain the functioning of designed (WbGAS) approach. The designed model is implemented in MATLAB software and then, the performance of the system is determined as specificity, recall, accuracy, and precision value. At the end, to verify the results of the developed technique a comparative assessment was performed by comparing the outcomes of presented approach with existing ML based approaches. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.

N2  - Heart murmurs are abnormal heart sounds that can indicate various heart diseases. Although traditional auscultation methods are effective, they depend more on specialists’ knowledge, making it difficult to make an accurate diagnosis. This paper presents a machine learning-based framework for the classification of acoustic sounds and heart murmurs using digital signal analysis. Using advanced machine learning algorithms, we aim to improve the accuracy, speed, and accessibility of heart murmur detection. The proposed method includes feature extraction from digital auscultatory recordings, preprocessing using signal processing techniques, and classification using state-of-the-art machine learning models. We evaluated the performance of different machine learning algorithms, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), random forests (RFs) and support vector machines (SVMs), on a selected heart noise dataset. The results show that our framework achieves high accuracy in differentiating normal heart sounds from different types of heart murmurs and provides a robust tool for clinical decision-making. © 2024 by the authors.

N2  - Background: Cardiovascular diseases kill approximately 17 million people globally every year, and they mainly exhibit as myocardial infarctions and heart failures. Heart failure (HF) occurs when the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the needs of the body.Available electronic medical records of patients quantify symptoms, body features, and clinical laboratory test values, which can be used to perform biostatistics analysis aimed at highlighting patterns and correlations otherwise undetectable by medical doctors. Machine learning, in particular, can predict patients' survival from their data and can individuate the most important features among those included in their medical records. Methods: In this paper, we analyze a dataset of 299 patients with heart failure collected in 2015. We apply several machine learning classifiers to both predict the patients survival, and rank the features corresponding to the most important risk factors. We also perform an alternative feature ranking analysis by employing traditional biostatistics tests, and compare these results with those provided by the machine learning algorithms. Since both feature ranking approaches clearly identify serum creatinine and ejection fraction as the two most relevant features, we then build the machine learning survival prediction models on these two factors alone. Results: Our results of these two-feature models show not only that serum creatinine and ejection fraction are sufficient to predict survival of heart failure patients from medical records, but also that using these two features alone can lead to more accurate predictions than using the original dataset features in its entirety. We also carry out an analysis including the follow-up month of each patient: even in this case, serum creatinine and ejection fraction are the most predictive clinical features of the dataset, and are sufficient to predict patients' survival. Conclusions: This discovery has the potential to impact on clinical practice, becoming a new supporting tool for physicians when predicting if a heart failure patient will survive or not. Indeed, medical doctors aiming at understanding if a patient will survive after heart failure may focus mainly on serum creatinine and ejection fraction. © 2020 The Author(s).

N2  - Using the Arduino platform under the Internet of Things (IoT) platform to diagnose individuals at risk of heart diseases. An enormous volume of data focus has been placed on delivering high-quality healthcare in response to the increasing prevalence of life-threatening health conditions among patients. Several factors contribute to the health conditions of individuals, and certain diseases can be severe and even fatal. Both in industrialised and developing nations, cardiovascular illnesses have surpassed all others as the leading causes in the last few decades. Significant decreases in mortality may be achieved by detecting cardiac problems early and keeping medical experts closely monitored. Unfortunately, it is not currently possible to accurately detect heart diseases in all cases and provide round-the-clock consultation with medical experts. This is due to the need for additional knowledge, time, and expertise. Aiming to identify possible heart illness using Deep Learning (DL) methods, this research proposes a concept for an IoT-based system that could foresee the occurrence of heart disease. This paper introduces a pre-processing technique, Transfer by Subspace Similarity (TBSS), aimed at enhancing the accuracy of electrocardiogram (ECG) signal classification. This proposed IoT implementation includes using the Arduino IoT operating system to store and evaluate data gathered by the Pulse Sensor. The raw data collected includes interference that decreases the precision of the classification. A novel pre-processing technique is used to remove distorted ECG signals. To find out how well the classifier worked, this study used the Hybrid Model (CNN-LSTM) classifier algorithms. These algorithms detect normal and abnormal heartbeat rates based on temporal and spatial features. A Deep Learning (DL) model that uses Talos for hyper-parameter optimisation has been recommended. This approach dramatically improves the accuracy of heart disease predictions. The experimental findings clearly show that Machine Learning (ML) methods for classification perform much better after preprocessing. Using the widely recognised MIT-BIH-AR database, we assess the planned outline in comparison to MCH ResNet. This system leverages a CNN-LSTM model, which was optimized using hyper-parameter tuning with Talos, achieving outstanding metrics. Specifically, it recorded an accuracy of 99.1%, a precision of 98.8%, a recall of 99.5%, an F1-score of 99.1%, and an AUC-ROC of 0.99. © (2024), (Science and Information Organization).

N2  - Background The analysis of cardiovascular borders (CVBs) in chest x-rays (CXRs) traditionally relied on subjective assessment and does not have established normal ranges. Objectives The authors aimed to develop a deep learning-based method for quantifying CVBs on CXRs and to explore its clinical utility. Methods This study used a prevalidated deep learning to analyze CVBs. A total of 96,129 normal CXRs from 4 sites were used to establish age- and sex-specific normal ranges of CVBs. The quantified CVBs were standardized into z-scores for newly inputted CXRs. The clinical utility of the z-score analysis was tested using 44,567 diseased CXRs from 3 sites (9,964 valve disease; 32,900 coronary artery disease; 1,299 congenital heart disease; 294 aortic aneurysm; 110 mediastinal mass). Results For distinguishing valve disease from normal controls, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the cardiothoracic ratio was 0.80 (95% CI: 0.80-0.80), while the combination of right atrium and left ventricle borders had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.83 (95% CI: 0.83-0.83). Between mitral and aortic stenosis, z-scores of CVBs were significantly different in the left atrial appendage (1.54 vs 0.33, P < 0.001), carinal angle (1.10 vs 0.67, P < 0.001), and ascending aorta (0.63 vs 1.02, P < 0.001), reflecting disease pathophysiology. Cardiothoracic ratio was independently associated with a 5-year risk of death or myocardial infarction in the coronary artery disease (z-score ≥2, adjusted HR: 3.73 [95% CI: 2.09-6.64], reference z-score <−1). Conclusions Deep learning-derived z-score analysis of CXR showed potential in classifying and stratifying the risk of cardiovascular abnormalities.

N2  - Over the last few decades, heart-related diseases or cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are considered to be the deadly disease which affects both men and women not only in India, as well as across the world. Diagnosing heart disease in the health care field can be a challenging task and many researchers devoting their time and knowledge to develop intelligent clinical decision support systems to improve the ability of the clinicians. Out of many machine learning techniques, classification is the most powerful technique which is commonly used for prediction. The rapid growth of complex data about patient medical records is the main source of discovering hidden knowledge for error-free decision-making. The main purpose of this study is to assist non-specialists in diagnosing heart disease risk limits and in diagnosing heart disease early. This paper introduces pre-processing models that have been applied on the University of California, Irvine (UCI) repository—Cleveland heart disease database for examining the accuracy and the error rate on predictions. The results obtained are compared and then verified using the Jupyter Notebook interface with the Scikit-Learn Library in PYTHON. In order to validate the efficacy of the proposed model, 75% training–25% testing is performed on the data set. Our analysis over few classification algorithms shows the efficacy of our proposed pre-processing models. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

N2  - Background Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) bears the highest global burden of under-5 mortality, with congenital heart disease (CHD) as a major contributor. Despite advancements in high-income countries, CHD-related mortality in SSA remains largely unchanged due to limited diagnostic capacity and centralized health care. While pulse oximetry aids early detection, confirmation typically relies on echocardiography, a procedure constrained by a shortage of specialized personnel. Artificial intelligence (AI) offers a promising solution to bridge this diagnostic gap. Objective This study aims to develop an AI-assisted echocardiography system that enables nonexpert operators, such as nurses, midwives, and medical doctors, to perform basic cardiac ultrasound sweeps on neonates suspected of CHD and extract accurate cardiac images for remote interpretation by a pediatric cardiologist. Methods The study will use a 2-phase approach to develop a deep learning model for real-time cardiac view detection in neonatal echocardiography, utilizing data from St. Padre Pio Hospital in Cameroon and the Red Cross War Memorial Children’s Hospital in South Africa to ensure demographic diversity. In phase 1, the model will be pretrained on retrospective data from nearly 500 neonates (0-28 days old). Phase 2 will fine-tune the model using prospective data from 1000 neonates, which include background elements absent in the retrospective dataset, enabling adaptation to local clinical environments. The datasets will consist of short and continuous echocardiographic video clips covering 10 standard cardiac views, as defined by the American Society of Echocardiography. The model architecture will leverage convolutional neural networks and convolutional long short-term memory layers, inspired by the interleaved visual memory framework, which integrates fast and slow feature extractors via a shared temporal memory mechanism. Video preprocessing, annotation with predefined cardiac view codes using Labelbox, and training with TensorFlow and PyTorch will be performed. Reinforcement learning will guide the dynamic use of feature extractors during training. Iterative refinement, informed by clinical input, will ensure that the model effectively distinguishes correct from incorrect views in real time, enhancing its usability in resource-limited settings. Results Retrospective data collection for the project began in September 2024, and to date, data from 308 babies have been collected and labeled. In parallel, the initial model framework has been developed and training initiated using a subset of the labeled data. The project is currently in the intensive execution phase, with all objectives progressing in parallel and final results expected within 10 months. Conclusions The AI-assisted echocardiography model developed in this project holds promise for improving early CHD diagnosis and care in SSA and other low-resource settings.

N2  - Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a sort of common cardiovascular disease. Artificial vision inspection on electrocardiogram (ECG) has turned into the mainstream diagnosis strategy for CHF detection, however it is strenuous and challenging. Motivated from bottleneck attention module (BAM), we construct an efficient architecture based on naive bidirectional gate recurrent unit (BGRU) for automatic CHF detection called BAM-BGRU. BAM-BGRU can refine the attention maps from both pathways: Channel attention and Spatial attention to enhance feature representation ability. To evaluate the effectiveness, we leverage naive GRU, BGRU and BAM as control groups with BIDMC congestive heart failure database (BCHFD) and congestive heart failure RR intervals database (CHFRID). The results achieve an obvious performance improvement than control groups and existing algorithms with an accuracy of 99.1% and 98.8%. Besides, we implement visualization analysis for multilevel derivative gradient flows of ECG episodes to strengthen model interpretability. To our knowledge, we first reformulate naive BGRU framework for consistent performance improvements showing promising potentials in diverse CNN backbones. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.

N2  - Diabetes is a leading health global health challenge because of its high blood sugar levels and the risk of extensive damage to other internal organs. Early and accurate identification of diabetes is important because it may cause other diseases including heart diseases and nerve damage. Despite the success of using machine learning, especially deep learning in automated diabetes diagnosis. These models are mostly black boxes which rarely offer comprehensive explanations and interpretations of the results. This study introduces DeepNetX2, a proposed custom deep neural network designed to overcome these challenges by integrating Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, specifically Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) and Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP). These techniques make the decision-making process of the model transparent, thereby increasing the credibility of the predictions. The proposed methodology entails a comprehensive data preprocessing technique that involves a customized Spearman’s correlation coefficient feature selection strategy. This preprocessing restricts complexity to only relevant features that promote effectiveness, instead of oversimplification, to the point of decreasing efficiency. DeepNetX2 was rigorously tested on three datasets: the PIMA dataset, local private dataset, and Type-2 diabetes dataset, achieving test accuracies of 94.81%, 97.87%, and 97.50%, respectively. These results demonstrate not only the superior performance of DeepNetX2 compared with existing models, but also its enhanced interpretability. Based on the proposed model, an appropriate and rapid strategy for diabetes prediction was developed which is very useful for improving diagnostic integrity and patient health.

N2  - Importance: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, and its early detection could lead to significant improvements in outcomes through the appropriate prescription of anticoagulation medication. Although a variety of methods exist for screening for AF, a targeted approach, which requires an efficient method for identifying patients at risk, would be preferred. Objective: To examine machine learning approaches applied to electronic health record data that have been harmonized to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model for identifying risk of AF. Design, Setting, and Participants: This diagnostic study used data from 2 252 219 individuals cared for in the UCHealth hospital system, which comprises 3 large hospitals in Colorado, from January 1, 2011, to October 1, 2018. Initial analysis was performed in December 2018; follow-up analysis was performed in July 2019. Exposures: All Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model-harmonized electronic health record features, including diagnoses, procedures, medications, age, and sex. Main Outcomes and Measures: Classification of incident AF in designated 6-month intervals, adjudicated retrospectively, based on area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and F1 statistic. Results: Of 2 252 219 individuals (1 225 533 [54.4%] women; mean [SD] age, 42.9 [22.3] years), 28 036 (1.2%) developed incident AF during a designated 6-month interval. The machine learning model that used the 200 most common electronic health record features, including age and sex, and random oversampling with a single-layer, fully connected neural network provided the optimal prediction of 6-month incident AF, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.800 and an F1 score of 0.110. This model performed only slightly better than a more basic logistic regression model composed of known clinical risk factors for AF, which had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.794 and an F1 score of 0.079. Conclusions and Relevance: Machine learning approaches to electronic health record data offer a promising method for improving risk prediction for incident AF, but more work is needed to show improvement beyond standard risk factors.

N2  - For diagnosing cardiovascular disease, an accurate segmentation method is needed. There are several unresolved issues in the complex field of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, some of which have been partially addressed by using deep neural networks. To solve two problems of over-segmentation and under-segmentation of anatomical shapes in the short-axis view from different cardiac magnetic resonance sequences, we propose a novel two-stage framework with a weighted decision map based on convolutional neural networks to segment the myocardium (Myo), left ventricle (LV), and right ventricle (RV) simultaneously. The framework comprises a decision map extractor and a cardiac segmenter. A cascaded U-Net++ is used as a decision map extractor to acquire the decision map that decides the category of each pixel. Cardiac segmenter is a multiscale dual-path feature aggregation network (MDFA-Net) which consists of a densely connected network and an asymmetric encoding and decoding network. The input to the cardiac segmenter is derived from processed original images weighted by the output of the decision map extractor. We conducted experiments on two datasets of multi-sequence cardiac magnetic resonance segmentation challenge 2019 (MS-CMRSeg 2019) and myocardial pathology segmentation challenge 2020 (MyoPS 2020). Test results obtained on MyoPS 2020 show that the average Dice coefficients of the proposed method on the segmentation tasks of Myo, LV and RV are 84.70%, 86.00%, and 86.31%, respectively. © 2013 IEEE.

N2  - Heart disease is the main cause of mortality across all age groups in the modern world. Thus, the necessity for improving heart attack prediction utilizing various machine learning (ML) or deep learning (DL) approaches is necessary for the health industry. Globally, the prognosis of heart disease can be improved by early diagnosis and treatment. The IoT purpose is to make simple way of making energy, wealth, and saving time easy with smart environment. The machine learning (ML) or deep learning (DL) techniques are used in various Internet of Things (IoT)-based technologies to reduce time, money, energy, and others for better performance or development. In this paper, we are going to see different kinds of machine learning and deep learning used in Internet of Things for heart disease detection system. As a starting point, we provide an overview of machine learning before moving on to explore various learning methods including deep learning models. We used EfficientNet-B0, a new convolutional network with faster training speed and better parameter efficiency than previous models. EfficientNet-B0 shows promising results for heart disease prediction. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.

N2  - A cardiac auscultation, being a very popular first line cardiovascular diseases screening method, typically produces phonocardiogram signals contaminated by background sounds, e.g., speech and movement of other patients and doctors/nurses, phone ringing and door knocking/opening/closing, and internal physiological body noises, e.g., lung sounds, muscle contraction and motion artifacts, as it is usually done in a noisy environment and it is not possible to suppress all the internal physiological body noises. So, a quality of the recording is finally decreased. Moreover, this can strongly affect a subsequent analysis/classification of the captured recording and can also lead to its incorrect classification. In this paper, we propose a novel deep convolutional architecture that integrates the bidirectional long short-term memory layers with the transformer blocks involving multi-head attention mechanism, which is particularly designed for denoising phonocardiogram signals. The performance of the proposed artificial intelligence-based approach is evaluated through synthetic data generated by using one public phonocardiogram dataset and two public real-world hospital ambient/respiratory sound databases as well as by deploying two public and renowned real-world clinical environment datasets containing phonocardiogram signals contaminated by various environmental and physiological noises recorded during the clinical auscultations. The deployed complex evaluation strategy assures a higher robustness and generalizability of the proposed approach. As also a result of that, the proposed model outperforms the current state-of-the-art approaches and provides the significant improvements in all the assessed signal quality and noise suppression metrics and over all the involved benchmark datasets. Finally, it should be noted here that the model achieved an average estimated SNR of 14.984 dB and 11.924 dB for the PASCAL and CirCor22 dataset respectively, which represent the renowned real-world clinical environment datasets.

N2  - During the last decade, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the de facto standard for various Computer Vision and Machine Learning operations. CNNs are feed-forward Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) with alternating convolutional and subsampling layers. Deep 2D CNNs with many hidden layers and millions of parameters have the ability to learn complex objects and patterns providing that they can be trained on a massive size visual database with ground-truth labels. With a proper training, this unique ability makes them the primary tool for various engineering applications for 2D signals such as images and video frames. Yet, this may not be a viable option in numerous applications over 1D signals especially when the training data is scarce or application specific. To address this issue, 1D CNNs have recently been proposed and immediately achieved the state-of-the-art performance levels in several applications such as personalized biomedical data classification and early diagnosis, structural health monitoring, anomaly detection and identification in power electronics and electrical motor fault detection. Another major advantage is that a real-time and low-cost hardware implementation is feasible due to the simple and compact configuration of 1D CNNs that perform only 1D convolutions (scalar multiplications and additions). This paper presents a comprehensive review of the general architecture and principals of 1D CNNs along with their major engineering applications, especially focused on the recent progress in this field. Their state-of-the-art performance is highlighted concluding with their unique properties. The benchmark datasets and the principal 1D CNN software used in those applications are also publicly shared in a dedicated website. While there has not been a paper on the review of 1D CNNs and its applications in the literature, this paper fulfills this gap. © 2020 The Author(s)

N2  - Analysis of cardiovascular health is an urgent task, as the number of patients with cardiovascular diseases is growing in the world. For the early diagnosis of these diseases, various studies of the cardiovascular health of patients are used, among which the analysis of electrocardiograms (ECG) is widely used. Classifiers based on machine learning models have been developed for automatic ECG analysis. At the same time, in medical practice, the SCORE scale is often used to assess the probability of risk of cardiovascular disease, which analyzes gender, age, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol and smoking. Therefore, this article proposes an approach and architecture for analyzing the cardiovascular health of patients that integrates automatic analysis of five types of heartbeats extracted from ECG with a linguistic assessment of the risk of cardiovascular disease on the SCORE scale. To classify heartbeats, a model based on RNN with LSTM neurons was developed, which showed an accuracy of 98.34% on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database test set. A system of rules that integrates the heartbeats class and the patient's SCORE assessment was developed to provide a linguistic description of cardiovascular health, useful in forming a medical conclusion. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

N2  - Background Valvular heart disease (VHD) remains underdiagnosed and results in serious complications. Early screening for VHD facilitates enhanced clinical management. Objectives This study aim to develop an artificial intelligence–based stethoscope model for detecting left-sided VHD, including aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, mitral stenosis, and mitral regurgitation. Methods Using an electronic stethoscope, we recorded heart sounds from derivation group to construct a machine learning algorithm. Then, the algorithm was tested on a testing group. Echocardiography was referred as the gold standard. Model performance was assessed using area under the receiver-operating characteristic (AU-ROC). Results A total of 514 patients were included in the final analyses (304 in the algorithm training group and 210 in the result testing group). The diagnostic performance of machine learning model was as follows: aortic stenosis (AU-ROC: 0.7621), aortic regurgitation (AU-ROC: 0.7075), mitral stenosis (AU-ROC: 0.6426), mitral regurgitation (AU-ROC: 0.7906), and left-sided VHD (AU-ROC: 0.8541; sensitivity 83.07%, specificity 78.26%). When applied to the testing group, the sensitivity, specificity, and AU-ROC for identifying left-sided VHD were 70.00%, 73.68%, and 0.7554, respectively. Conclusions Artificial intelligence–based stethoscope is capable of diagnosing left-sided VHD accurately and may make routine screening for VHD more practical.

N2  - Heart health is vital for the survival of all living things. Heart-related illnesses require more precision, accuracy, and correctness in diagnosis and prognosis since even a small mistake might have fatal consequences. Each year, numerous people die from heart-related causes, and this figure is sharply rising. As a first step toward solving the problem, a disease prediction system and more public awareness are required. An increasing number of people are suffering from heart disease every minute, and it has now become a major public health issue. A complicated mix of medical and pathological data is frequently required for the diagnosis of cardiac disease which results in significant medical costs, which have an impact on the standard of care. To make predictions about heart disease based on medical information, this study was undertaken. Using Fast and Lightweight AutoML (FLAML), we analyzed a large dataset with 14 different categories, such as age, gender, medical measures, and test results. Machine learning algorithms, hyperparameters, and model ensembles were all selected, regulated, and optimized automatically by the FLAML framework. High levels of accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC in our heart disease prediction models were generated by using FLAML. FLAML's streamlined process saves doctors and nurses precious minutes every day, paving the way for more accurate risk assessments and more effective treatment of heart disease thanks to the power of predictive analytics. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.

N2  - Electrocardiogram (ECG) plays a critical role in early prevention and diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. However, extracting powerful deep features from ECG signal for recognition is still a challenging problem today due to the variable abnormal rhythms and noise distribution. This work proposes a Bi-LSTM algorithm based on heterogeneous features fusion and attention mechanism (HFFAM + Bi-LSTM). Combining the empirical features and the features learned by the deep learning network, HFFAM + Bi-LSTM can comprehensively extract the temporal frequency information and spatial structure information of the ECG signal. Meanwhile, a novel attention mechanism based on improved DTW (AM-DTW) is designed to analyze and control the fusion process of features. The role of AM-DTW in HFFAM + Bi-LSTM is twofold, one is to measure the feature similarity between ECG signal sets with different labels using the improved DTW, and the other is to distinguish the features into isomorphic and heterogeneous features as well as adaptive weighting of the features. It is worth mentioning that overly similar isomorphic features are filtered out to further optimize the algorithm. Thus, HFFAM + Bi-LSTM has the advantage of strengthening the heterogeneous information in the feature subspace while accounting for the isomorphic features. The accuracy of HFFAM + Bi-LSTM reaches up to 98.1 % and 97.1 % on the simulated and real datasets, respectively. Compared to the all benchmark models, the classification accuracy of HFFAM + Bi-LSTM is 1.3 % higher than the best. The experiments also demonstrate that HFFAM + Bi-LSTM has better performance compared with existing methods, which provides a new scheme for automatic detection of ECG signal. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - Background Identifying structural heart diseases (SHDs) early can change the course of the disease, but their diagnosis requires cardiac imaging, which is limited in accessibility. Objectives The purpose of this study was to leverage images of 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) for automated detection and prediction of multiple SHDs using an ensemble deep learning approach. Methods We developed a series of convolutional neural network models for detecting a range of individual SHDs from images of ECGs with SHDs defined by transthoracic echocardiograms performed within 30 days of the ECG at the Yale New Haven Hospital (YNHH). SHDs were defined as left ventricular ejection fraction <40%, moderate-to-severe left-sided valvular disease (aortic/mitral stenosis or regurgitation), or severe left ventricular hypertrophy (interventricular septal diameter at end-diastole >1.5 cm and diastolic dysfunction). We developed an ensemble XGBoost model, PRESENT-SHD (Practical scREening using ENsemble machine learning sTrategy for SHD detection), as a composite screen across all SHDs. We validated PRESENT-SHD at 4 U.S. hospitals and the prospective, population-based ELSA-Brasil (Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health) cohort, with concurrent protocolized ECGs and transthoracic echocardiograms. We also used PRESENT-SHD for risk stratification of new-onset SHD or heart failure (HF) in clinical cohorts and the population-based UK Biobank. Results The models were developed using 261,228 ECGs from 93,693 YNHH patients and evaluated on a single ECG from 11,023 individuals at YNHH (19% with SHD), 44,591 across external hospitals (20%-27% with SHD), and 3,014 in the ELSA-Brasil (3% with SHD). In the held-out test set, PRESENT-SHD demonstrated an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.886 (95% CI: 0.877-894), 90% sensitivity, and 66% specificity. At hospital-based sites, PRESENT-SHD had AUROCs ranging from 0.854 to 0.900, with sensitivities and specificities of 93% to 96% and 51% to 56%, respectively. The model generalized well to ELSA-Brasil (AUROC 0.853 [95% CI: 0.811-0.897], 88% sensitivity, 62% specificity). PRESENT-SHD demonstrated consistent performance across demographic subgroups, novel ECG formats, and smartphone photographs of ECGs from monitors and printouts. A positive PRESENT-SHD screen portended a 2- to 4-fold higher risk of new-onset SHD/heart failure, independent of demographics, comorbidities, and the competing risk of death across clinical sites and UK Biobank, with high predictive discrimination. Conclusions We developed and validated PRESENT-SHD, an AI-ECG tool identifying a range of SHD using images of 12-lead ECGs, representing a robust, scalable, and accessible modality for automated SHD screening and risk stratification.

N2  - Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) hold promise for revolutionizing healthcare, but challenges related to model explainability and data availability persist. Federated learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving solution for health data usage by enabling decentralized model training without data sharing. In this study, we propose a novel framework that integrates explainable AI (XAI) with FL, specifically targeting heart arrhythmia detection. AI based heart arrhythmia detection usually relies heavily on the analysis of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. We propose an attention based temporal convolutional network (TCN) for the analysis of time-series ECG data. The FL approach enables collaborative training across multiple local AI models without compromising local data or patients privacy. The attention mechanism is employed to enable the model to capture long-term dependencies across multiple time steps and weight different parts of the signal accordingly for improved classification performance. From the attention layer of the network we extract the attention weights for explanation. These weight values show important property of the model as well as input signal. To evaluate the proposed approach, we conducted experiments using the MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset comprising 300 time steps per full beat cycle and 5 major arrhythmia classes. Our model achieved a balanced accuracy of 93.5%, F1-score of 98.7%, and 93.4% G-mean score in the presence of imbalanced data distributions. Notably, the explainability aspect of our model demonstrated consistent explanations comparable to expert benchmarks from related literature, enhancing trust and interpretability. Overall, this study underscores the potential of explainable FL with attention-based TCN architecture to enhance arrhythmia detection by prioritizing both privacy-preservation, performance and interpretability. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

N2  - Background: Atrial septal defect (ASD) is one of the most common congenital heart diseases. The diagnosis of ASD via transthoracic echocardiography is subjective and time-consuming. Methods: The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of automatic detection of ASD in children based on color Doppler echocardiographic static images using end-to-end convolutional neural networks. The proposed depthwise separable convolution model identifies ASDs with static color Doppler images in a standard view. Among the standard views, we selected two echocardiographic views, i.e., the subcostal sagittal view of the atrium septum and the low parasternal four-chamber view. The developed ASD detection system was validated using a training set consisting of 396 echocardiographic images corresponding to 198 cases. Additionally, an independent test dataset of 112 images corresponding to 56 cases was used, including 101 cases with ASDs and 153 cases with normal hearts. Results: The average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, recall, precision, specificity, F1-score, and accuracy of the proposed ASD detection model were 91.99, 80.00, 82.22, 87.50, 79.57, and 83.04, respectively. Conclusions: The proposed model can accurately and automatically identify ASD, providing a strong foundation for the intelligent diagnosis of congenital heart diseases. © 2023 Beijing Zhongke Journal Publishing Co.

N2  - There are very few studies are carried for investigating the potential of hybrid ensemble machine learning techniques for building a model for the detection and prediction of heart disease in the human body. In this research, the authors deal with a classification problem that is a hybridization of fusion-based ensemble model with machine learning approaches, which produces a more trustworthy ensemble than the original ensemble model and outperforms previous heart disease prediction models. The proposed model is evaluated on the Cleveland heart disease dataset using six boosting techniques named XGBoost, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, LightGBM, CatBoost, and Histogram-Based Gradient Boosting. Hybridization produces superior results under consideration of classification algorithms. The remarkable accuracies of 96.51% for training and 93.37% for testing have been achieved by the Meta-XGBoost classifier. © 2022 IGI Global. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background Atrial septal defects (ASDs) are frequently closed percutaneously. Despite successful closure, many patients still develop atrial arrhythmias. There is inconsistent data on the risk factors associated with these atrial arrhythmias. As such, we aimed to develop a machine learning (ML) model predicting atrial arrhythmias following transcatheter ASD closure in adolescents and adults. Methods Patients with secundum-type ASDs undergoing transcatheter closure between 2008 and 2024 at a single center were retrospectively analyzed. Patients with prior atrial arrhythmias were excluded. A deep neural network, adapted via transfer learning from a large external ECG dataset, was used to extract predictive features from preprocedural 12-lead ECGs. These features were combined with clinical, demographic, biochemical and hemodynamic variables in ensemble survival models. Model performance was assessed using the integrated Brier scores and the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC). Results A total of 148 adult patients (median 44.4 years [30.6–57.8], 105 females [70.9 %]) were eligible for included. There were a total of 1055 person-years of follow-up (median follow-up 7.3 [3.1–11.3]), during which 28 patients (18.9 %) developed atrial arrhythmias. The final ensemble ML model incorporating ECG-derived features demonstrated strong predictive performance (integrated Brier score 0.044, mean AUC 0.823). Subgroup and sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the model across various patient profiles. Conclusions We developed a novel ML-based risk model using a transfer learning approach to predict atrial arrhythmias after transcatheter ASD closure. Further research and external validation are needed to refine the proposed risk stratification prior to clinical implementation.

N2  - Background Accurate measurement of echocardiographic parameters is crucial for the diagnosis of cardiovascular disease and tracking of change over time; however, manual assessment requires time-consuming effort and can be imprecise. Artificial intelligence has the potential to reduce clinician burden by automating the time-intensive task of comprehensive measurement of echocardiographic parameters. Objectives The purpose of this study was to develop and validate open-sourced deep learning semantic segmentation models for the automated measurement of 18 anatomic and Doppler measurements in echocardiography. Methods We trained models for the automated measurement of echocardiography parameters using data sets between 2011 and 2023 from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (CSMC). The outputs of segmentation models were compared with sonographer measurements from temporal split data from CSMC and an external data set from Stanford Healthcare (SHC) to access accuracy and precision. Results We used 877,983 echocardiographic measurements from 155,215 studies from CSMC to develop EchoNet-Measurements, an open-source deep learning model for echocardiographic annotation. The models demonstrated high accuracy when compared with sonographer measurements from held-out data from CSMC and an independent external validation data set from SHC. Measurements across all 9 B-mode and 9 Doppler measurements had high accuracy (mean coverage probability of 0.796 and 0.839 and mean relative difference of 0.120 and 0.096 on held-out test set from CSMC and external data set from SHC, respectively). When evaluated end-to-end on 2,103 temporally distinct studies at CSMC, EchoNet-Measurements had similar reasonable performance (mean coverage probability 0.803 and mean relative difference of 0.108). Performance was consistent across patient characteristics including age, sex, and atrial fibrillation, obesity status, and machine vendors. Conclusions EchoNet-Measurements achieves high accuracy in automated echocardiographic quantification and potential for assisting the clinicians in the echocardiography workflow. This open-source model provides the foundation for future developments in artificial intelligence applied to echocardiography.

N2  - Coronary artery disease (CAD) is one of the diseases with the highest morbidity and mortality in the world. In 2019, the number of deaths caused by CAD reached 9.14 million. The detection and treatment of CAD in the early stage is crucial to save lives and improve prognosis. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to develop a machine-learning system that can be used to help diagnose CAD accurately in the early stage. In this paper, two classical ensemble learning algorithms, namely, XGBoost algorithm and Random Forest algorithm, were used as the classification model. In order to improve the classification accuracy and performance of the model, we applied four feature processing techniques to process features respectively. In addition, synthetic minority oversampling technology (SMOTE) and adaptive synthetic (ADASYN) were used to balance the dataset, which included 71.29% CAD samples and 28.71% normal samples. The four feature processing technologies improved the performance of the classification models in terms of classification accuracy, precision, recall, F<inf>1</inf> score and specificity. In particular, the XGBboost algorithm achieved the best prediction performance results on the dataset processed by feature construction and the SMOTE method. The best classification accuracy, recall, specificity, precision, F<inf>1</inf> score and AUC were 94.7%, 96.1%, 93.2%, 93.4%, 94.6% and 98.0%, respectively. The experimental results prove that the proposed method can accurately and reliably identify CAD patients from suspicious patients in the early stage and can be used by medical staff for auxiliary diagnosis. © 2022 by the authors.

N2  - An electrocardiogram (ECG) is an essential piece of medical equipment that helps diagnose various heart-related conditions in patients. An automated diagnostic tool is required to detect significant episodes in long-term ECG records. It is a very challenging task for cardiologists to analyze long-term ECG records in a short time. Therefore, a computer-based diagnosis tool is required to identify crucial episodes. Myocardial infarction (MI) and conduction disorders (CDs), sometimes known as heart blocks, are medical diseases that occur when a coronary artery becomes fully or suddenly stopped or when blood flow in these arteries slows dramatically. As a result, several researchers have utilized deep learning methods for MI and CD detection. However, there are one or more of the following challenges when using deep learning algorithms: (i) struggles with real-life data, (ii) the time after the training phase also requires high processing power, (iii) they are very computationally expensive, requiring large amounts of memory and computational resources, and it is not easy to transfer them to other problems, (iv) they are hard to describe and are not completely understood (black box), and (v) most of the literature is based on the MIT-BIH or PTB databases, which do not cover most of the crucial arrhythmias. This paper proposes a new deep learning approach based on machine learning for detecting MI and CDs using large PTB-XL ECG data. First, all challenging issues of these heart signals have been considered, as the signal data are from different datasets and the data are filtered. After that, the MI and CD signals are fed to the deep learning model to extract the deep features. In addition, a new custom activation function is proposed, which has fast convergence to the regular activation functions. Later, these features are fed to an external classifier, such as a support vector machine (SVM), for detection. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated by the experimental findings, which show that it improves satisfactorily with an overall accuracy of 99.20% when using a CNN for extracting the features with an SVM classifier. © 2022 by the authors.

N2  - Heart disease includes many kinds of conditions affecting the heart and has been the main cause of death worldwide in recent decades. To prevent further damage and preserve patients’ lives, it is crucial to detect heart disease early and adequately. Consequently, we require an approach capable of predicting heart disease before it progresses to a critical stage. Researchers in the field of medical sciences are interested in machine learning. They use several machine learning algorithms and methodologies for predicting heart disease. A weighted K-nearest neighbor model using feature scores is proposed in this study to increase classification accuracy. Initially, we used the K-means clustering method to group similar features, selecting the one with the highest relevance in each group. Following this selection, we employed the relief feature selection technique to determine the scores, which will be used as weights. The proposed approach is applied to five aggregated datasets from IEEE Data Port or Kaggle, including Hungarian, Cleveland, Long Beach VA, Switzerland, and Statlog (Heart). Several performance metrics, such as the AUC curve, recall, precision, F1-score, and accuracy, are utilized to assess the efficacy and strength of the constructed model. The underlying study concluded that the weighted KNN has outperformed all other algorithms used in this study for comparison across all measures. It had the best accuracy of 93.28%. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

N2  - Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death and more than half million people were died around the world. However, cardiovascular health monitoring is crucial for effective heart disease diagnosis and management. In this paper, a novel deep learning-based YOLO-ECG model is proposed to ECG arrhythmia classification method for portable monitoring. Initially, the ECG signals are gathered using 12-lead electrodes in the real time and these signals are denoised using two-dimensional stationary wavelet transform (2D-SWT). In SWT, zeros are inserted between filter taps rather than decimal points to eliminate repetitions and increase robustness. The denoised ECG signals are fed into the deep learning-based YOLO network with Gaussian error linear unit (GELU) activation function for detecting the ECG abnormalities of arrythmia. ECG waveforms are analyzed for the local fractal dimension at each sample point before heartbeat waveforms are extracted within a set length window. A squeeze and excitation attention (SEAN) module is introduced in the YOLO network for selecting size of 1D convolution kernel, and the dimension is preserved during local cross-channel interactions, decrease network complexity and enhance model efficiency. The classification findings demonstrate that the proposed YOLO-ECG model performs better by ECG recordings from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset. From the experimental analysis, the proposed YOLO-ECG model yields the overall accuracy of 99.16% for efficient classification of arrythmia ECG signals. © 2024 - IOS Press. All rights reserved.

N2  - Coronary atherosclerotic heart disease is one of the main causes of death from cardiovascular diseases. Early detection of atherosclerotic lesions can help clinicians understand the condition of cardiovascular patients and provide reference for better treatment measures. Compared with other detection technologies, intravascular optical coherence tomography (IVOCT) has the advantages of no radiation, high resolution, and high imaging speed. Therefore, it plays an important role in the detection and evaluation of atherosclerotic plaque. Although IVOCT has been widely used in the detection of plaque in coronary vessels, the imaging system could not directly provide effective plaque feature identification information, and clinicians can only judge the characteristics of plaque according to their own experience. Based on a brief introduction of the application of IVOCT in detecting coronary atherosclerotic plaque, this paper introduces the method of eliminating the vascular motion artifact caused by cardiac pulsation. The automatic segmentation and classification of IVOCT images are studied by using machine learning method. And the plaque features of calcified plaque, lipid plaque and fibrous plaque in IVOCT images are extracted. The deep learning algorithm is used to analyze the characteristics of vulnerable plaque and put forward quantitative evaluation indicators. It is very important to develop the intelligent recognition system of IVOCT in plaque type, that provide objective, intuitive and accurate plaque classification marks, display and rupture risk assessment for the clinic. So that clinicians can get rid of the current situation of relying solely on experience for lesion recognition, and save patients' lives in time. © 2022 SPIE.

N2  - Emerging research on artificial intelligence (AI) has leveraged the unique properties of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals for user identification. ECG signals, known for their resistance to forgery and tampering, offer security advantages. However, these signals fluctuate in response to physical and cognitive stress. Despite their security benefits, these dynamic characteristics present challenges for consistent user identification owing to their variable amplitudes and shapes. To address these problems, we propose a 2-stage user identification system that integrates ECG signals and status information. This system classifies the user’s ECG status and uses the feature values in a second model to improve dynamic feature learning ability. This allows identification with high accuracy even in various stress states of the user. This increases the real-life usability of the ECG user identification system. The effectiveness of the proposed method was confirmed through a performance evaluation using CSU-BIODB(Chosun University-BIO Database) and the public MIT-BIH(Massachusetts Institute of Technology - Beth Israel Hospital Arrhythmia Laboratory) ST Change database, with identification accuracies of 92.08% and 95.83%, and f1-scores of 0.9207 and 0.9369, respectively. Compared with existing single user identification models, our approach demonstrated accuracy improvements of 9.3% and 36.76% for each database. These findings underscore the potential of the new 2-stage model for enhancing the practicality of ECG-based user identification systems and provide a promising foundation for future research on deep learning signal processing.

N2  - Cardiovascular diseases are responsible for twenty five per cent of the deaths in India and across the world. Indians are affected by CVDs at a much earlier age compared to the other demographics. Given the severity of the situation an early prediction of heart disease is of utmost importance. Heart diseases can be determined using a combination of clinical and pathological data. Often the volume of these data is too vast for the human brain to compute. Hence, we use machine learning algorithms to predict heart disease in human beings using the above mentioned data. This paper is concerned with the comparison of the various models and to determine which one of them is best suited for the prediction. The models used in this paper are Logistic Regression, Decision tree, Naive Bayes, SVM, K-Nearest Neighbours and Random Forest. It was found that logistic regression performed best with the accuracy of 85.25%. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

N2  - Machine learning (ML) based heart disease prediction has emerged as a crucial and fruitful field of study and application. They are used to analyze medical data, identify cardiac disorders, and make precise predictions about their presence or absence. Utilizing the effectiveness of LR (Logistic Regression) in combination with sophisticated preprocessing methods has emerged as an important strategy in the classification of heart-related diseases. By addressing data variability and differences in feature sizes, the use of decimal scaling and min-max normalization, in particular, improves the interpretability and flexibility of the model. By detecting complex underlying patterns and nonlinear interactions within the data, the use of Isomap (Isomeric Feature Mapping) normalization enhances the LRs (Logistic Regression) discriminative powers. This Scope of research has shown the possibility to produce higher classification results through a thorough review procedure that includes accuracy, precision, and recall criteria. Isomeric Feature Mapping along with LR gives best result with accuracy of 91%, precision of 0.89 and recall of 0.87 respectively. This proposed system is compared with the existing methods like Min-Max Normalization+ LR, and Decimal Scaling Normalization+ LR. The tool used for execution is python. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

N2  - Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) has become a serious reason of death all over the world. According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare report, CVD was the underlying cause of 42,700 deaths (25% of all) in 2021. Therefore, accurate detection of CVD is crucial for early treatment. An Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal is used to measure the rhythms and electrical activity of the heart. Traditionally, paper-based ECG images are used to detect CVD which may not be accurate always. The existing pre-trained models such as transfer learning can be used for automatic diagnosis. However, they fall short of multiclass classification due to complex variations of the ECG signals. For this research, four cardiac abnormalities including Abnormal Heartbeats, Myocardial Infarction, History of Myocardial Infarction, and Normal Heartbeats are predicted using the combination of machine learning and deep learning techniques. The deep learning method is used for feature extraction and the machine learning algorithm is used for classification. A lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is designed to extract the prominent features from ECG images and use these features for the prediction of CVDs. However, only a classifier may not fully utilize extracted features for classification. Therefore, the proposed method developed an optimized weighted average ensemble model for classifier selection. The proposed ensemble-based lightweight model showed its ability to extract informative features when tested on real ECG datasets and outperformed the baseline methods by achieving the highest accuracy of 99.29%.

N2  - Early detection of cardiac arrhythmia, a prevalent form of cardiovascular disease (CVD) impacting millions globally, is heavily reliant on the accurate analysis of heartbeats. Physicians often recommend that patients wear Holter monitors for 24 h or longer to observe concerning cardiac issues, resulting in the collection of substantial amounts of electrocardiogram (ECG) data. Consequently, there is a need to automate the process of interpreting ECGs to detect cardiac abnormalities efficiently. Current state-of-the-art studies rely on handcrafted feature extraction, which may not effectively capture the intricate temporal relationships inherent in ECG signal data. To address this limitation and facilitate the diagnosis of cardiac diseases, this study proposes a technique that converts electrocardiogram signals into images, subsequently training a deep learning model on the generated images. Image encoding techniques such as Gramian Angular Difference Field (GADF), Gramian Angular Summation Field (GASF) and Markov Transition Field (MTF) are employed to translate the ECG signals into images. The highest accuracy, 96.71%, was achieved by training the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using the concatenation of these three image encoding techniques. The proposed approach is assessed using ECG recordings from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database to detect heart arrhythmia, demonstrating the efficacy of the approach. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature 2024.

N2  - The term “heart or cardiovascular disease” is frequently used to refer to a variety of heart-related issues. It is one of the illnesses with the highest mortality rate. Its fatality rate results in nearly 17 million deaths worldwide. Given the daily increase in heart disease cases, predicting any disease early is critical and concerning. Early detection of heart disease is a difficult task that must be accomplished carefully and effectively by gathering precise information about the patient who is at risk for heart disease. To predict whether a person has cardiac disease, there are numerous AI-based (Machine/Deep learning) Models available considering medical characteristics (features) of heart disease. By comparing and contrasting several machine learning classifiers, this paper proposed a heart disease prediction system. This system will aid in identifying and predicting whether the patient is likely to have or be diagnosed with heart disease based on his or her current medical state. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.
